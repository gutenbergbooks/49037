NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL
WARFARE ASPECT OF THE MEDICAL THREAT</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_1-1" id="Para_1-1"></a>1-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> After World War II, the Soviet Union represented the principal threat to the national security
interests of the US. During this period, the military capability of the Soviet Armed Forces grew enormously.
Starting in the later years of the 1980s, the international security environment has undergone rapid,
fundamental, and revolutionary changes. With the collapse of Soviet communism, the Soviet Union
disintegrated as a viable economic and political system. The Warsaw Pact dissolved as a political and
military entity. The central Soviet government was replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), dominated by the Russian Republic. The cohesion of Soviet strategic military capability has been
fractured by&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>The dissolution of central Soviet control.</li>

<li>The formation of the CIS.</li>

<li>The unpredictability associated with uncertain loyalties and low morale.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The ultimate outcome of these events in terms of US national security interests is unclear. The military
capabilities of CIS like Russia, Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus remain formidable. The capabilities
include strategic nuclear and impressive conventional, biological, and chemical warfighting capabilities.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> From a global perspective, the economic power and influence of developing and newly
industrialized nations continue to grow. Centers of power (global or regional) cannot be measured solely in
military terms. Nation states pursuing their own political, ideological, and economic interests may become
engaged in direct or indirect competition and conflict with the US. More nations have acquired significant
numbers of modern, lethal, combat weapon systems; developed very capable armed forces; and become
more assertive in international affairs. In the absence of a single, credible, coercive threat, old rivalries and
long repressed territorial ambitions will resurface, causing increased tensions in many regions. Political,
economic, and social instability and religious, cultural, and economic competition will continue to erode the
influence of the US over the rest of the world. This erosion will also reduce the US influence of traditional
regional powers over their neighbors. This environment will encourage the continued development, or acquisition,
of modern armed forces and equipment by less influential nations; thus raising the potential for the use of NBC/RDD
weapons during internal conflict and armed confrontations in developing regions of the world.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> A third dimension to the threat is terrorist, rogue groups, and belligerents employing a number
of chemical and biological agents and the possible use of TIM to injure or kill US personnel. The actions
may be isolated or may be imposed by groups of individuals. Most will have the financial backing of
nations, large organizations, or groups that have the desire to cause harm and create public distrust in our
government.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_1-2" id="Para_1-2"></a>1-2. Medical Threat</h4>

<p class="noindent">Medical threat is the composite of all ongoing or potential enemy actions and environmental conditions that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-2" id="Page_1-2">[1-2]</a></span>
will reduce combat effectiveness through wounding, injuring, causing disease, and/or degrading
performance. Soldiers are the targets of these threats. Weapons or environmental conditions that will
generate wounded, injured, and sick soldiers, beyond the capability of the HSS system to provide timely
medical care from available resources, are considered major medical threats. Weapons or environmental
conditions that produce qualitatively different wound or disease processes are also major medical threats.
Added to the combat operational and disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI) medical threats are adversary use
of the following types of weapons, agents, and devices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biological warfare agents.</li>

<li>Chemical warfare agents.</li>

<li>Nuclear weapons.</li>

<li>Toxic industrial materials.</li>

<li>Radiological dispersal devices.</li>

<li>Directed-energy devices/weapons.</li>

<li>Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Para_1-3" id="Para_1-3"></a>1-3. Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Radiological Dispersal Device Threats&mdash;The Health Service
Perspective</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Nuclear Weapons and Radiological Dispersal Device Threats.</i> Since the breakup of the Soviet
Union, the number of countries with known nuclear capable military forces has almost doubled. Available
information suggests that a number of countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa have or may have
nuclear weapons capability within the next decade. <a href="#TAB_1-1">Table 1-1</a> lists those countries known to have, suspected
of possessing, or seeking, nuclear weapons. Planners can expect, as a minimum, 10 to 20 percent casualties
within a division-sized force that has experienced a nuclear strike. In addition to the casualties, a nuclear
weapon detonation can generate an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that will cause catastrophic failures of
electronic equipment components. Radiological dispersal devices, comprised of an explosive device with
radioactive material, can be detonated without the need for the components of a nuclear weapon. The RDD
can disperse radioactive material over an area of the battlefield causing effects from nuisance levels of
radioactive material to life-threatening levels without the thermal and, in most cases, the blast effects of a
nuclear detonation. For nuclear weapons effects see <a href="#APP_A">Appendix A.</a></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Biological Warfare.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Biological warfare (BW) is defined by the US intelligence community as the intentional
use of disease-causing organisms (pathogens), toxins, or other agents of biological origin (ABO) to
incapacitate, injure, or kill humans and animals; to destroy crops; to weaken resistance to attack; and to
reduce the will to fight. Historically, BW has primarily involved the use of pathogens in assassinations or as
sabotage agents in food and water supplies to spread contagious disease among target populations.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) For purposes of medical threat risk assessment, we are interested only in those BW
agents that incapacitate, injure, or kill humans or animals.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Known or suspect BW agents and ABOs can generally be categorized as naturally
occurring, unmodified infectious agents (pathogens); toxins, venoms, and their biologically active fractions;
modified infectious agents; and bioregulators. See <a href="#TAB_1-2">Table 1-2</a> for examples of known or suspected BW
threat agents. Also, <a href="#TAB_1-3">Table 1-3</a> presents possible developmental and future BW agents.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(4) Many governments recognize the industrial and economic potential of advanced
biotechnology and bioengineering. The same knowledge, skills, and methodologies can be applied to the
production of second and third generation BW agents. Naturally occurring infectious organisms can be
made more virulent and antibiotic resistant and manipulated to render protective vaccines ineffective.
These developments complicate the ability to detect and identify BW agents and to operate in areas
contaminated by the BW agents. For biological agent characteristics and effects see <a href="#APP_A">Appendix A.</a> The first
indication that a BW agent release/attack has occurred may be patients presenting at a medical treatment
facility with symptoms not fitting the mold for endemic diseases in the area of operations (AO). See
<a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for sampling requirements, sampling procedures, packaging and shipping, and chain of custody
requirements.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Chemical Warfare.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Since World War I, most western political and military leaders have publicly held
chemical warfare (CW) in disrepute. However, evidence accumulated over the last 50 years does not
support the position that public condemnation equates to limiting development or use of offensive CW
agents. The reported use of chemical agents and biological toxins in Southeast Asia by Vietnamese forces;
the confirmed use of CW agents by Egypt against Yemen; and later by Iraq against Iranian forces; and the
probable use of CW agents by the Soviets in Afghanistan indicate a heightened interest in CW as a force
multiplier. Also, an offensive CW capability is developed as a deterrent to the military advantage of a
potential adversary. For a list of common chemical agents, their characteristics, behavior, and effects see
<a href="#APP_A">Appendix A</a>. <a href="#TAB_1-4">Table 1-4</a> lists those countries known or suspected of having offensive chemical weapons.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) The Russian Republic has the most extensive CW capability in Europe. Chemical strikes
can be delivered with almost any type of conventional fire support weapon system (from mortars to long-range
tactical missiles). Agents known to be available in the Russian inventory include nerve agents
(O-ethyl methyl phosphonothiolate [VX], thickened VX, Sarin [GB], and thickened Soman [GD]); vesicants
(thickened Lewisite[L] and mustard-Lewisite mixture[HL]); and choking agent (phosgene). Although not
considered CW agents, riot control agents are also in the Russian inventory.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) The US is in the process of destroying its stockpiles of CW weapons. Many weapons
have already been destroyed and the storage facilities have been rendered safe of all CW agent residues.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d. Toxic Industrial Materials.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Toxic industrial materials can present a medical threat for deployed forces. Toxic industrial materials are
comprised of toxic industrial biologicals (TIB), toxic industrial chemicals (TIC), and toxic industrial
radiological (TIR) materials. These materials are found throughout the world and are used on a daily basis
for commercial and private purposes. Large storage facilities, transportation tankers (over the road and
railcars), as well as smaller containers of material, pose a danger to the health of personnel. Accidental
spills or releases and terrorist actions can all lead to release of these materials into the environment causing
potential casualty producing effects. Medical treatment facilities and nuclear power plants use radioactive
materials that can pose a health hazard if accidentally released or used by hostile forces, terrorists, or others
to contaminate an area. Biological materials used in medical research and pharmaceutical manufacturing
may be used by hostile forces, terrorists, or others to produce casualties. Many TICs produce the same
effects on personnel as CW agents. As a matter of fact, many TICs are of the same chemical structure as
CW agents. However, there is quite a difference in their potency; in most TICs the potency is much lower.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-6" id="Page_1-6">[1-6]</a></span>
For example, chlorine used to treat water supplies has also been used as a CW agent; organophosphate
pesticides can cause the same effects as some nerve agents. Hostile forces, terrorists, or others may use
RDDs to produce casualties as well. For detailed information on toxic industrial materials see FM 8-500.</p>

COMMAND AND CONTROL</h2>

<h4><a name="Para_2-1" id="Para_2-1"></a>2-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">The US forces may be attacked by or exposed to NBC, TIM, lasers, advanced electronics, high explosives,
fuel-air, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'thermoberic'">thermobaric</ins>, and conventional weapons; or a combination of these weapons/materiel. Mass
casualty situations will be the rule and not the exception. Mass casualty situations can occur anyplace on the
battlefield. Combined NBC and conventional weapons injuries may predominate. Command and control
(C2) will be essential to prevent casualties and to provide effective HSS. However, C2 (to include HSS C2)
elements may be primary targets. Effective HSS in an NBC environment can be accomplished, but only if
necessary preparations to survive and to be mission capable are taken. Increased HSS C2 actions are
needed to maintain HSS proximity to the supported force; to clear the battlefield; to move and resupply the
HSS units, while managing multiple simultaneous mass casualty incidents; and to rapidly evacuate patients.
Health service support C2 units must push HSS augmentation to mass casualty sites, clear the site, evacuate
the patients to Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) that can provide essential care or out of the AO;
decontaminate and extract medical forces from NBC contaminated areas and redistribute or redeploy the
HSS forces. Within medical units, C2 will be challenged by the use of protective clothing and equipment,
the need to move (either to the patients or out of the contaminated area), and obtaining additional support.
Health service support advisers and staff officers must provide guidance to commanders on continued duty
for personnel who have been exposed to NBC weapons/agents and TIM effects. Leaders must greatly
increase coordinating, preplanning, using tactical standing operating procedures (TSOPs), and establishing
multiple C2 mechanisms. See <a href="#APP_C">Appendix C</a> for guidelines on operational planning for health service support
in an NBC or TIM environment. See <a href="#APP_D">Appendix D</a> for medical planning guide on NBC casualties. See
<a href="#APP_E">Appendix E</a> for a sample format of a "medical NBC staff officer appendix to annex Q."</p>


<h4><a name="Para_2-2" id="Para_2-2"></a>2-2. Health Service Support Command and Control Planning Considerations</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Battle situational understanding is of great importance on the NBC battlefield. The number of
casualties from each NBC attack will overwhelm any single medical unit or MTF causing the medical
commander/leader to take action. To the extent possible, the commander/leader should be prepared for the
requirement instead of reacting to it. To ensure responsive C2 the HSS plan must consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Likely targets (C2 nodes, main supply routes (MSR), supply nodes, troop concentrations,
key terrain features, key forces, or other high value targets).</li>

<li>Patient estimates (conventional, NBC, and TIM).</li>

<li>Availability of HSS resources (preestablished support plans).</li>

<li>Availability of required nonmedical support (patient decontamination teams).</li>

<li>Ability to maintain operations if C2 is lost at any HSS level.</li>

<li>Ability to maintain C2 operations when normal communication systems have been
disabled due to EMP effects or other system failures.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-2" id="Page_2-2">[2-2]</a></span>
Ability to maintain C2 operations while the unit is operating in mission-oriented protective
posture (MOPP) Level 4 (reduced audio and visual acuity).</li>

<li>The requirements for immunizations, pretreatments, barrier creams, prophylaxis, insect
repellents, and other medical countermeasures to protect the forces.</li>

<li>The resource requirements for treatment, MEDEVAC, and hospitalization (including
care for enemy prisoners of war [EPW]).</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Clearing the battlefield will require preplanning and close coordination at all levels. Early
resuscitation, stabilization, and prompt medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) are mandatory for survival of the
sick and wounded.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> For conventional operations C2 see FM 8-10. Field Manual 8-55 provides HSS planning for
conventional operations.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Provisions for emergency medical care of civilians, consistent with the military situation. All
non-DOD civilian care must be approved by the AO Commander in Chief/senior official and coordinated
with the civil affairs unit and/or country team. For eligibility of care determinations guidance, see FM 8-10.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> For additional information on planning operations in an NBC environment see FMs 8-10,
4-02.10, 4-02.4, 4-02.6, 4-02.283, 8-9, 8-10-6, 8-10-26, 8-284, and 8-285. Higher headquarters must
distribute timely plans and directives to subordinate units to ensure that the subordinate unit's HSS plan
supports their plan.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_2-3" id="Para_2-3"></a>2-3. Health Service Support Command and Control Appraisal of the Support Minion</h4>

<p class="noindent">The HSS personnel make an appraisal of the supported mission to determine the expected patient load.
Once the appraisal has been accomplished, HSS personnel prepare for the HSS mission by assigning
personnel responsibilities. Using triage and EMT decision matrices for managing patients in a contaminated
environment improves treatment proficiency. See <a href="#FIG_2-1">Figure 2-1</a> for a sample decision matrix. Training HSS
personnel in the use of simple decision matrices should enhance their effectiveness and contribute to a more
efficient battlefield HSS process. Prior training for designated nonmedical personnel in patient
decontamination procedures will enhance their effectiveness in the overall patient care mission. See
<a href="#APP_D">Appendix D</a> for planning factors on the estimation of NBC casualties.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_2-4" id="Para_2-4"></a>2-4. Health Service Support Units</h4>

<p class="noindent">Health service support units must plan, train, and routinely practice mass casualty management. The NBC
attack or TIM event will likely be in conjunction with enemy conventional operations. But, the TIM event
may be caused by terrorist or belligerent action. There will likely be increased conventional casualties in
addition to the NBC/TIM related casualties. The supply and transportation units will be using the MSR in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-3" id="Page_2-3">[2-3]</a></span>support of the combat commander's requirements; thus, impacting on patient MEDEVAC and HSS unit
resupply. Communications will be disrupted. Therefore, HSS C2 must plan and prepare for conducting
operations with limited or no communications with other HSS organizations.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_2-5" id="Para_2-5"></a>2-5. Movement/Management of Contaminated Facilities</h4>

<p class="noindent">Operations in a contaminated area require the HSS commander/leader to operate with contaminated or
potentially contaminated assets. The following provides guidance in determining how to operate with
contaminated facilities:</p>

<p class="para-a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-4" id="Page_2-4">[2-4]</a></span>
<i>a. Fulfill Health Service Support Principles.</i> In making his decision to move or continue to
operate with contaminated facilities, the commander/leader must apply the principles of conformity,
proximity, flexibility, mobility, continuity, and control. The unit's operation must conform to the tactical
commander's operation plan (OPLAN). Health service support must be provided to the tactical unit as far
forward as possible; this ensures prompt, timely care. Additionally, the HSS commander/leader must be
flexible; his support must be tailored to meet the supported commander's OPLAN requirements. Therefore,
HSS assets must be as mobile as the unit they support. Finally, the HSS commander/leader must control his
assets. Dispersion on the integrated battlefield may enhance unit survivability; but the HSS commander/leader
may not be able to maintain control of his assets, they may become compromised.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b. Decision to Move.</i> The HSS commander/leader (when deciding to move his unit to an
uncontaminated area or in support of the tactical commander's plan) must base his decision to move on
several factors.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <i>Protection available.</i> What type of protection is available in the new area? Will he need
to establish the units' collective protection shelter (CPS) systems, or are indigenous shelters available (for
example, buildings, tunnels, caves)? Does the unit have sufficient individual protective equipment for unit
personnel?</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <i>Persistency.</i> If his unit has been in a contaminated area, is the contamination persistent
or nonpersistent? Is the area he will move to contaminated or clean? Persistency determines the MOPP
level; the degree of threat; and performance decrement caused by the protective measures used. The level
of contamination will determine whether employment of CPS is viable. The MTF may be able to continue to
operate at the location by employing CPS. Personnel and patient decontamination must be accomplished
before processing into the CPS.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) <i>Patients.</i> Before moving the entire facility, the HSS commander/leader must consider
the number and types of patients at the MTF; his ability to redirect en route patients to the new MTF
location; and his ability to evacuate the patients currently on hand. All patients should be stabilized before
movement; but, MEDEVAC must be continued.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) <i>Alternate facilities.</i> Alternate facilities may be used (if the facility can be configured to
ensure continuity of care or provide a protected area for patients) until the relocating activity is up and
operating. This is a viable consideration when CPS is not available or the current location is contaminated
with a persistent agent. Patient decontamination cannot be performed in an area heavily contaminated with
a persistent agent.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) <i>Medical evacuation.</i> Consideration must always be given to the patient. Routes of
MEDEVAC must be disseminated to supported and supporting units. The ability to evacuate patients
during the move must continue. All MEDEVAC considerations must be addressed before any move.</p>

<p class="para-1">(6) <i>Mobility.</i> An MTF that is not 100 percent mobile requires movement support. Thus, the
commander/leader must coordinate movement support requirements with higher headquarters.</p>

<p class="para-1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-5" id="Page_2-5">[2-5]</a></span>
(7) <i>Mission.</i> The primary consideration is the support mission of the MTF. The tactical
commander requires continuous HSS for his personnel; when a move jeopardizes the quality of care, the
move may be delayed.</p>

<p class="para-1">(8) <i>Sustainability.</i> Hand-in-hand with the mission is sustainability (the ability of the unit to
continue its support mission). If the current location of the MTF hinders the unit's ability to sustain its
support mission, then the MTFs support to the unit is in question. Similarly, if moving the MTF will result
in a disruption of support, then the move may not be viable.</p>

<p class="para-1">(9) <i>Decontamination.</i> When a nonpersistent agent hazard exists and a CPS is not available,
patients may be directed to another MTF until the hazard is gone; or the MTF can move to a contamination
free area. Certain facilities may be decontaminated, patient protection procedures applied, and the operation
continued. However, an MTF contaminated with a persistent agent requires time-consuming and resource-intensive
decontamination operations; it may include replacement of contaminated shelters.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c. Management of Contaminated and "Clean" Facilities.</i> Facilities contaminated with a persistent
agent may be too resource intensive to decontaminate. Operating with a combination of contaminated assets
and "clean" assets may be necessary. Mark contaminated assets with standard warning tags. Use these
assets in contaminated environments and along contaminated routes. Keep clean assets in operation in clean
areas. Of primary importance is proper marking and the avoidance of cross contamination.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d. Medical Supplies and Equipment for Patient Treatment.</i> Are sufficient medical supplies and
equipment available to perform the anticipated mission? Does the unit have special medical equipment
sets available (chemical agent patient decontamination and chemical agent patient treatment medical
equipment sets)?</p>


<h4><a name="Para_2-6" id="Para_2-6"></a>2-6. Leadership on the Contaminated Battlefield</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Operating on a contaminated battlefield will stress leadership. Heat stress from being in
higher levels of MOPP for long periods of time may lead to dehydration. The commander/leader must
ensure that his personnel rest, drink, and eat sufficiently to allow them to continue with the mission. In the
midst of activity, rest, hydration, and nutrition are often overlooked; however, a good leader will ensure
that his personnel needs are met. See FM 21-10 for work/rest cycles and water drinking requirements.
Individuals may suffer hyperventilation because of the enclosed feelings. Personnel remaining in MOPP
Level 4 around the clock may suffer from increased sleep loss. Use of CPS can reduce this problem by
allowing the personnel to rest out of their MOPP gear. Leaders must share leadership responsibilities and
delegate responsibilities as much as possible so that each one gets sufficient rest to maintain unit effectiveness.
Further, leaders should concentrate on supervision or unit mission, rather than on generation of new procedures
during and after an attack. The NBC battlefield will, therefore, require more proactive and dedicated leaders
who can balance the needs of their personnel and the mission. Further, leaders will be challenged by an
additional logistics burden of providing nontraditional respiratory protection for personnel against TIMs.
For detailed information on combat operational stress control (COSC) see FM 8-51 and FM 22-51.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-6" id="Page_2-6">[2-6]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 c-black font-sans small">
<br />
<p class="center bold">DANGER</p>

<p class="noindent">The standard NBC protective mask will not protect
personnel from most TICs.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Leadership must plan for and establish procedures to maintain personnel performance during
NBC operations. Personnel performance while wearing MOPP is degrading. At MOPP Level 3 or 4, all
but the most basic patient care procedures may have to be suspended because&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Wearing gloves reduces the ability to grasp and manipulate small items (fine motor skill).</li>

<li>MOPP impedes the ability to move about (gross motor skills).</li>

<li>The mask reduces visual fields and acuity (visual skills).</li>

<li>The mask and hood greatly reduces vocalization and hearing abilities (auditory skills).</li>

<li>The MOPP creates significant heat and mental stress (stamina). Heat injuries can occur
in a very short period of time.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_2-7" id="Para_2-7"></a>2-7. Homeland Security</h4>

<p class="noindent">Commanders and leaders must plan for and be prepared to support homeland security efforts; especially,
for response to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) events.
Depending upon the location of the event, the response may be to a military installation in support of the
weapons of mass destruction&mdash;installation support team (WMD-IST) or to an event site off a military
installation. Response to a CBRNE event off a military installation will normally require a request for
Department of Defense support to the event from the first responders to the event (usually from the incident
commander or lead federal agency [Federal Bureau of Investigation or Federal Emergency Management
Agency]). See <a href="#APP_C">Appendix C</a> for planning considerations.</p>

<h2><span class="ch"><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER 3</a></span><br /><br />

LEVELS I AND II HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT</h2>

<h4><a name="Para_3-1" id="Para_3-1"></a>3-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The use of NBC weapons is a condition of battle and HSS personnel must prepare to operate in
these environments. Added is the dimension of TIM releases/incidents in the operational area. The
importance of preventive medicine (PVNTMED) measures and first aid (self-aid, buddy aid, and combat
lifesaver [CLS] support) are even more critical. Heat and stress injuries related to MOPP wear are issues
for the HSS leadership as well as the force he is supporting. The stress load on personnel is increased by
the concerns of being exposed to TIM releases. Considering that staffing of HSS units is based upon the
minimum required to provide support on a conventional battlefield, they will be challenged to provide the
same level of HSS in these environments.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The HSS leadership must quantify the HSS capability to their commanders. The medical staff
must review OPLANS and make recommendations to reduce the number of patients. Medical NBC training
programs must stress the essential imperative of immediate decontamination, the need to monitor your
buddy for NBC and heat or combat/operational stress injury effects, and the proper use of NBC defense
prophylaxis, pretreatments, insect repellents, barrier creams, and immunizations.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Maintaining close proximity to the supported force has been a major tenet of HSS doctrine and
a critical factor in reducing the mortality rate. Maintaining this proximity and finding a place clean enough
to provide necessary care requires intense coordination with the supported force. Alternate casualty
collection points, decontamination sites, medical treatment sites, and MEDEVAC routes must be established,
coordinated and communicated to the lowest level practical. Communication will be much more difficult,
but must be maintained. Timely reports through the HSS technical channels will allow an optimal HSS
response. Replacements for HSS front line losses must be rapidly filled after NBC weapons are employed.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Contamination (NBC and TIMs) can significantly hinder HSS operations. To maximize the
unit's survivability and HSS capabilities and to avoid such contamination, leaders must use&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Contamination avoidance techniques.</li>

<li>Alarms and detection equipment.</li>

<li>Unit dispersion techniques.</li>

<li>Overhead shelter, shielding material, protective cover, and buildings of opportunity.
However, these shelters may not provide protection from chemical vapor or BW hazards.</li>

<li>Collective protection shelters, if available. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F.</a></li>

<li>Chemical agent resistant coatings on equipment.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> On the NBC battlefield, as on the conventional battlefield, HSS is focused on keeping soldiers
in the battle. Effective and efficient PVNTMED measures, triage, emergency medical treatment (EMT),
decontamination, advanced trauma management (ATM), and contamination control in the AO saves lives,
assures judicious MEDEVAC, and maximizes the return to duty (RTD) rate.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-2" id="Page_3-2">[3-2]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_3-2" id="Para_3-2"></a>3-2. Level I Health Service Support</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Level I (unit-level) HSS may consist of a combat medic section, a MEDEVAC section, and a
treatment squad. The treatment squad operates the Level I MTF (battalion aid station [BAS]). Level I HSS
is supported by first aid in the form of self-aid/buddy aid and the CLS. See FM 4-02.4 for detailed
information on conventional Level I HSS.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> When operating under an NBC threat or when NBC attack is imminent, the BAS must prepare
for continuation of its mission. Should an attack occur or a downwind hazard exist, the BAS must seek out
a contamination free area to establish a clean treatment area, or must establish collective protection to
continue the mission. Some BASs have Chemically Biologically Protected Shelter (CBPS) Systems. When
available, these systems serve as the primary shelter for the BAS; they are operated in the full chemical/biological
(CB) mode when attack is imminent or has occurred. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> for information on
establishing a BAS in a CBPS system. When operating in the CB mode only patients requiring life- or limb-saving
procedures are allowed entry at the BAS. Patients that have minor injuries that can be managed in
the contaminated EMT area of the patient decontamination site will receive treatment in this area. After
treatment, these patients will have the integrity of their MOPP restored by taping the damaged area and
returned to duty. Patients with injuries that require further treatment, but who can survive evacuation to the
Level II MTF will have their MOPP spot decontaminated, their injuries managed, the integrity of their
MOPP restored, and be directed to an evacuation point to await transport to the Level II MTF (example, an
individual with a splinted broken arm). When patients or personnel are contaminated or are potentially
contaminated, they must be decontaminated before admission into the clean treatment area (see FM 3-5 for
personnel decontamination procedures and <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for patient decontamination procedures).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-3" id="Para_3-3"></a>3-3. Level II Health Service Support</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> In the brigade, Level II HSS consists of&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Evacuating patients from the BAS and MEDEVAC on an area support basis from within
the brigade support area (BSA).</li>

<li>Providing area support Level I medical treatment.</li>

<li>Operating the medical company clearing station (hereafter referred to as the division
clearing station [DCS]), which <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'proves'">provides</ins> a patient holding capability for up to 40 patients for 72 hours. See
FM 4-02.6 and FM 8-10-24 for detailed information on Level II conventional operations.</li>

<li>Providing limited dental service.</li>

<li>Providing limited PVNTMED support in the areas of medical surveillance, occupational
and environmental health surveillance, food service sanitation, water quality control (including NBC
contamination surveillance), and communicable disease control.</li>

<li>Providing limited COSC; these patients are returned to duty as far forward as their
condition permits.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-3" id="Page_3-3">[3-3]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> In the division, HSS is the same as for the brigade, except patients may be evacuated from the
BSA DCS, but not evacuated from the BAS.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> When operating under an NBC threat or when NBC attack is imminent, the DCS must prepare
for continuation of its mission. Should an attack occur or a downwind hazard exist the DCS must seek out a
contamination free area, or must establish collective protection to continue the mission. The DCS in some
medical companies have four CBPS Systems; they are complexed to provide space for DCS operations.
These systems are operated in the CB mode when attack is imminent or has occurred. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> for
information on establishing a DCS in CBPS Systems. When operating in the CB mode only patients
requiring life- or limb-saving procedures are allowed entry. Patients with minor injuries that can be
managed in the contaminated EMT area of the patient decontamination site will receive treatment in this
area. After treatment, these patients will have the integrity of their MOPP restored by taping the damaged
area and returned to duty. Patients with injuries that require further treatment, but who can survive
evacuation to the Level III MTF will have their MOPP spot decontaminated, their injuries managed, and be
directed to an evacuation point to await transport to the Level III MTF (example, an individual with a
splinted broken arm). When personnel and patients are contaminated or are potentially contaminated, they
must be decontaminated before admission into the clean treatment area (see FM 3-5 for personnel
decontamination procedures and <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for patient decontamination procedures).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-4" id="Para_3-4"></a>3-4. Forward Surgical Team</h4>

<p class="noindent">Forward surgical teams (FST) are either organic to divisional and nondivisional medical units or are
forward deployed in support of divisional or nondivisional medical companies to provide a surgical
capability. Field Manual 8-10-25 describes FST operations. However, when forward deployed and NBC
contamination is imminent the FST must employ collective protection in order to continue their support
mission. When operating in a contaminated area the FST CBPS Systems must be complexed with the DCS
CBPS. The FST cannot operate in an NBC environment without the support of the DCS. They do not have
the capability to decontaminate patients. All patients are decontaminated in the DCS patient decontamination
area. They are then processed into the EMT section of the DCS; where they are triaged and routed to the
FST for surgery, if required. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> for FST employment of collective protection procedures.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-5" id="Para_3-5"></a>3-5. Actions Before a Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical Attack</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Given the disruption of transportation, communications, and operations during and following
an NBC attack, it should be clear that preparation is the key to survival and effectively providing HSS.
Preparing a simple and complete TSOP and HSS plan that really integrates NBC is the first step. Critical
training for medical personnel before an NBC attack is how to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Survive the attack individually and as a unit.</li>

<li>Operate the Level I or Level II MTF in the environment.</li>

<li>Effectively care for NBC patients.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-4" id="Page_3-4">[3-4]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Even minimal site preparation (nuclear hardening or CB protecting) may improve survival,
greatly reduce contamination, and maintain the ability to continue to provide HSS. See the discussion
below for more information on each environment. As with other military personnel, HSS personnel must
keep their immunizations current; use available prophylaxis against suspect CB agents; use pretreatments
for suspect chemical agents; use insect repellents, and have antidotes and essential medical supplies readily
available for known or suspected NBC effects. The best defense for HSS personnel is to protect themselves,
their patients, medical supplies, and equipment by applying contamination avoidance procedures. They
must ensure that stored medical supplies and equipment are in protected areas or in their storage containers
with covers in place. One method of having supplies and equipment protected is to keep them in their
shipping containers until actually needed. When time permits and warnings are received that an NBC attack
is imminent, or that a downwind hazard exists, HSS personnel should employ their CPS (see <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a>)
or seek protected areas (buildings, tents, or other ABOVE ground shelters for biological or chemical attack;
culverts, ravines, basements, or other shielded areas for nuclear) for themselves and their patients.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Other tasks include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verifying NBC defense HSS inventories are complete.</li>

<li>Reviewing supported units NBC plans, procedures, casualty collection points,
decontamination sites, and resources available to support the HSS mission.</li>

<li>Coordinating with the S2/G2, S3/G3 and S4/G4 of the supported unit to develop the
medical courses of action; to obtain necessary materiel to support extended operations without resupply
(MSR contamination or transportation support not available).</li>

<li>Coordinating with supported units for at least eight nonmedical personnel for patient
decontamination augmentation at the Level I and II MTFs.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_3-6" id="Para_3-6"></a>3-6. Actions During a Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical Attack</h4>

<p class="noindent">While it is possible that the NBC attack will be discrete short events, the more likely scenario is the enemy
will use NBC throughout the conflict. The warning and reporting system will provide as much notice as is
possible. Using the information provided, HSS personnel will continue their mission by using the best
available protected areas. If warned of a nuclear attack, they take up positions within the best available
shelter; movement out of these positions will be directed by leadership when it is safe to do so.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-7" id="Para_3-7"></a>3-7. Actions After a Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical Attack</h4>

<p class="noindent">All personnel must survey their equipment to determine the extent of damage and their capabilities to
continue the mission. Initially, patients from nuclear detonations will be suffering thermal burns or blast
injuries. Also, expect patients and HSS personnel to be disoriented. Nuclear blast and thermal injuries will
immediately manifest, most radiation-induced injuries will not be observed for several hours to days. Chemical
agent patients will manifest their injuries immediately upon exposure to the agent, except for blister agents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-5" id="Page_3-5">[3-5]</a></span>
Biological agent patients may not show any signs of illness for hours to days after exposure, except for
trichothecene (T<sub><small>2</small></sub>) mycotoxins. All patients arriving at Levels I and II MTFs must be checked for NBC
contamination. Patients are decontaminated before treatment (see <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a>) to reduce the hazard to HSS
personnel, unless life- or limb-threatening conditions exist. Patients requiring treatment before decontamination
are treated in the EMT area of the patient decontamination station. Examples of patient conditions that may
require treatment at the contaminated treatment station of the patient decontamination area&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Massive hemorrhage.</li>

<li>Respiratory distress.</li>

<li>Severe shock.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_3-8" id="Para_3-8"></a>3-8. Logistical Considerations</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Health service logistics (HSL) personnel must train and prepare to operate in all battlefield
situations. Operating in an NBC environment requires the issue of chemical patient treatment medical
equipment set and chemical patient decontamination medical equipment set. Expect disruption of MSR and
communications systems and plan accordingly. See FM 4-02.1 and FM 8-10-9 for details on HSL operations.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The medical platoon (Level I) is authorized two chemical agent patient treatment medical
equipment sets and one chemical agent patient decontamination medical equipment set. Each chemical
agent patient treatment medical equipment set has enough supplies to treat 30 patients. Each chemical agent
patient decontamination medical equipment set has enough consumable supplies to decontaminate 60 patients.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd60">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The chlorine granules in the chemical agent patient decontamination
set are used to prepare the hypochlorite solutions for use to
decontaminate patients.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The brigade, divisional, and nondivisional medical <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'company's'">companies</ins> are authorized five chemical
agent patient treatment medical equipment sets and three chemical agent patient decontamination medical
equipment sets. These medical equipment sets are for use at the DCS patient decontamination station.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-9" id="Para_3-9"></a>3-9. Personnel Considerations</h4>

<p class="noindent">During NBC actions, HSS personnel requirements increase; thus, HSS reinforcement or replacements are
necessary. Plans for HSS in a NBC battlefield must include efforts to conserve available HSS personnel
and ensure their best use. HSS personnel will be fully active in providing EMT or ATM care; they will
provide more definitive treatment as time and resources permit. However, to provide care they must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-6" id="Page_3-6">[3-6]</a></span>
able to work in a shirt-sleeved environment, not in MOPP Levels 3 or 4. Nonmedical personnel conduct
search and rescue operations for the injured or wounded; they provide immediate first aid and
decontamination. See FM 3-5, for detailed information on personnel and equipment decontamination
operations. See FMs 4-02.283, 8-284, and 8-285 for detailed information on treatment of NBC patients.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-10" id="Para_3-10"></a>3-10. Disposition and Employment of Treatment Elements</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Select sites for the BAS and DCS that are located away from likely enemy target areas. Cover
and concealment is extremely important; they increase protection for operating the MTF.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Operating a CBPS System in the CB mode at the BAS requires at least eight medical personnel.
The senior NCO performs patient triage and limited EMT and minor injury care in the patient
decontamination area. One trauma specialist supervises patient decontamination and manages patients
during the decontamination process. Two trauma specialists work on the clean side of the hot line and
manage the patients until they are placed in the clean treatment area or are sent into the CBPS for treatment.
They also manage the patients that are awaiting MEDEVAC to the DCS. The physician, physician
assistant, and two trauma specialists provide ATM in the clean treatment area or inside the CBPS. See
<a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> for CPS entry/exit procedures.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> When the BAS or DCS are receiving NBC contaminated patients, they require at least eight
nonmedical personnel from supported units to perform patient decontamination procedures. These facilities
are only staffed to provide patient care under conventional operational conditions. Without the augmentation
support, they can either provide patient decontamination or patient care, but not both.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> A patient decontamination station is established to handle contaminated patients (see <a href="#APP_G">Appendix
G</a>). The station is separated from the clean treatment area by a "hot line" and is located downwind of the
clean treatment area or CPS. Personnel on both sides of the "hot line" assume a MOPP level commensurate
with the threat agent employed (normally MOPP Level 4). The patient decontamination station should be
established in a contamination-free area of the battlefield. However, it may be necessary to establish a
patient decontamination station that is collocated with an MTF that is employing a CBPS, in a chemical
vapor hazard area in order to decontaminate patients and clear the battlefield before moving the MTF to a
clean area. When CPS systems are not available, the clean treatment area is located upwind 30 to 50 meters of
the contaminated work area. When personnel in the clean working area are away from the hot line, they may
reduce their MOPP level. Chemical monitoring equipment must be used on the clean side of the hot line to
detect vapor hazards due to slight shifts in wind currents; if vapors invade the clean work area, HSS personnel
must re-mask to prevent low-level CW agent exposure and minimize clinical effects (such as miosis).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-11" id="Para_3-11"></a>3-11. Civilian Casualties</h4>

<p class="noindent">Civilian casualties may become a problem in populated or built-up areas, as they are unlikely to have
protective equipment and training. The BAS and DCS may be required to provide assistance when civilian
medical resources cannot handle the workload. However, aid to civilians will not be undertaken without
command approval, or at the expense of health services provided to US personnel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-7" id="Page_3-7">[3-7]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_3-12" id="Para_3-12"></a>3-12. Nuclear Environment</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The HSS mission must continue in a nuclear environment; protected shelters are essential to
continue the support role. Well-constructed shelters with overhead cover and expedient shelters (reinforced
concrete structures, basements, railroad tunnels, or trenches) provide good protection from nuclear attacks
(see <a href="#APP_H">Appendix H</a>). Armored vehicles provide some protection against both the blast and radiation effects of
nuclear weapons. Patients generated in a nuclear attack will likely suffer multiple injuries (combination of
blast, thermal, and radiation injuries) that will complicate medical care. Nuclear radiation patients fall into
three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>irradiated</i> patient is one who has been exposed to ionizing radiation, but is not
contaminated. They are not radioactive and pose no radiation threat to medical care providers. Patients
who have suffered exposure to initial nuclear radiation will fit into this category.</li>

<li>The <i>externally contaminated</i> patient has radioactive dust and debris on his clothing, skin,
or hair. This radioactive debris can cause burns if not removed quickly. This usually presents a
"housekeeping" problem to the MTF, similar to the lice-infested patient arriving at a peacetime MTF.
However, an accumulation of radioactive debris, from several patients admitted to the MTF, may present a
threat to other personnel. The externally contaminated patient is decontaminated at the earliest time
consistent with required medical care. Lifesaving care is always rendered, when necessary, before
decontamination.</li>

<li>The <i>internally contaminated</i> patient is one that has ingested or inhaled radioactive
material, or radioactive material has entered the body through an open wound. The radioactive material
continues to irradiate the patient internally until radioactive decay and/or biological elimination removes the
radioactive isotope. Attending medical personnel are shielded, to some degree, by the patient's body.
Inhalation, ingestion, or injection of quantities of radioactive material sufficient to present a threat to health
care providers is highly unlikely.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Medical units operating in a radiation fallout environment will face three problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The MTF may be immersed in fallout, requiring decontamination and relocation efforts.</li>

<li>Patients may continue to be produced from continued radiation exposure.</li>

<li>The contaminated environment hinders MEDEVAC.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Decontamination of most radiological contaminated patients and equipment can be
accomplished with soap and water. Soap and water will not neutralize radioactive material. However, it
will remove the material from the skin, hair or material surface. See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for specific patient
decontamination procedures. The waste can become a concentrated point of radiation and must be managed
and monitored.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Commanders and leaders must consider the radiation exposure levels for themselves, their
staffs, and patients when operating in or determining if the unit will enter a radiologically contaminated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-8" id="Page_3-8">[3-8]</a></span>
area. The commander and leader must establish an operational exposure guide for their unit and personnel.
The operational exposure guide (OEG) is established for either battlefield exposures as shown in <a href="#TAB_3-1">Table 3-1</a>
or for exposures in stability operations and support operations as shown in <a href="#TAB_3-2">Table 3-2</a>. The tables present
radiation exposure status (RES) categories; however, they can be used to establish OEGs based on the same
exposure criteria.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_3-13" id="Para_3-13"></a>3-13. Medical Triage</h4>

<p class="noindent">Medical triage is the classification of patients according to the type and seriousness of illness or injury; this
achieves the most orderly, timely, and efficient use of HSS resources. However, the triage process and
classification of nuclear patients differs from conventional injuries. See FM 4-02.283 for nuclear patient
triage and treatment procedures.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-14" id="Para_3-14"></a>3-14. Biological Environment</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> A biological attack (such as the enemy use of bomblets, rockets, spray or aerosol dispersal,
release of arthropod vectors, and terrorist or insurgent contamination of food and water) may be difficult to
recognize. Frequently, it does not have an immediate effect on exposed personnel. All HSS personnel must
monitor for BW indicators such as&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Increases in disease incidence or fatality rates.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-9" id="Page_3-9">[3-9]</a></span>
Sudden presentation of an exotic disease.</li>

<li>Other sequential epidemiological events.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Passive defensive measures (such as immunizations, good personal hygiene, physical
conditioning, using arthropod repellents, wearing protective mask, and practicing good sanitation) will
mitigate the effects of many biological agent intrusions.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The HSS commanders and leaders must enforce contamination control to prevent illness or
injury to HSS personnel and to preserve the facility. Incoming vehicles, personnel, and patients must be
surveyed for contamination. Ventilation systems in MTFs (without CPS) must be turned off if BW
exposure is imminent.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Decontamination of most BW contaminated patients and equipment can be accomplished with
soap and water. Soap and water will not kill all biological agents; however, it will remove the agent from
the skin or equipment surface. See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for specific patient decontamination procedures.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Treatment of BW agent patients may require observing and evaluating the individual to
determine necessary medications, isolation, or management. See FM 8-284 for specific treatment procedures
for BW agent patients.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Medical surveillance is essential. Most BW agent patients initially present common symptoms
such as low-grade fever, chills, headache, malaise, and coughs. More patients than normal may be the first
indication of biological attack. Daily medical treatment summaries, especially DNBI, need to be prepared
and analyzed. Trends of increased numbers of patients presenting with unusual or the same symptoms are
valuable indicators of enemy employment of BW agents. Daily analysis of medical summaries can provide
early warnings of BW agent use, thus enabling commanders to initiate preventive measures earlier and
reduce the total numbers of troops lost due to the illness. See FM 4-02.17 for information of medical
surveillance procedures. See FM 8-284 for preventive, protective, and treatment procedures.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-15" id="Para_3-15"></a>3-15. Chemical Environment</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Consider that all patients generated in a CW agent environment are contaminated. The vapor
hazards associated with contaminated patients may require HSS personnel to remain at MOPP Level 4 for
long periods. The MTF must be set up in clean areas or employ CPS. If there is liquid agent contamination,
or a continued vapor hazard, the MTF should be moved and be decontaminated, mission permitting.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Initial triage, EMT, and decontamination are accomplished on the "dirty" side of the hot line.
Life-sustaining care is rendered, as required, without regard to contamination. Normally, the senior health
care sergeant performs initial triage and EMT at the BAS. Secondary triage, ATM, and patient disposition
are accomplished on the clean side of the hot line. When treatment must be provided in a contaminated
environment outside the CPS, the level of care may be greatly reduced because medical personnel and
patients are in MOPP Level 3 or 4. However, lifesaving procedures must be accomplished. See FM 8-285
for specific treatment of CW agent patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-10" id="Page_3-10">[3-10]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Decontamination of most chemically contaminated patients and equipment requires the use of
materials that will remove and neutralize the agent. See FM 3-5 for equipment decontamination procedures
and <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for specific patient decontamination procedures.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-16" id="Para_3-16"></a>3-16. Operations in Extreme Environments</h4>

<p class="noindent">Enemy employment of NBC weapons or TIMs in the extremes of climate or terrain warrants additional
consideration. Included are the peculiarities of urban terrain, mountains, snow and extreme cold, jungle,
and desert operations in an NBC environment with the resultant NBC-related effects upon medical treatment
and MEDEVAC. For a more detailed discussion on NBC aspects of urban terrain, mountain, snow and
extreme cold, jungle, and desert operations, see FMs 3-06.11, 31-71, 90-3, 90-5, and 90-10.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> In mountain operations, passes and gorges may tend to channel the nuclear blast and the
movement of chemical and biological agents. Ridges and steep slopes may offer some shielding from
thermal radiation effects. Close terrain may limit concentrations of troops and fewer targets may exist;
therefore, a lower patient load may be anticipated. However, the terrain will complicate patient evacuation
and may require patients to be decontaminated, treated, and held for longer periods than would be required
for other operational areas.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The effects of extreme cold weather combined with NBC-produced injuries have not been
extensively studied. However, with traumatic injuries, cold hastens the progress of shock, providing a less
favorable prognosis. Thermal effects will tend to be reinforced by reflection of thermal radiation from
snow and ice-covered areas. Care must be exercised when moving chemically contaminated patients into a
warm shelter. A CW agent on the patient's clothing may not be apparent. As the clothing warms to room
temperature, the CW agent will vaporize (off-gas), contaminating the shelter and exposing occupants to
potentially hazardous levels of the agent. A three-tent system is suggested for processing patients in
extreme cold operations. The first tent (unheated) is used to strip off potentially contaminated clothing.
The second (heated) is used to perform decontamination, perform EMT and detect off gassing. The third
(heated) is used to provide the follow on care and patient holding.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> In rain forests and other jungle environments, the overhead canopy will, to some extent, shield
personnel from thermal radiation. However, the canopy may ignite and create forest fires and result in burn
injuries. By reducing sunlight, the canopy may increase the persistency effect of CW agents near ground
level. The canopy also provides a favorable environment for BW agent dispersion and survival.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> In desert operations, troops may be widely dispersed, presenting less profitable targets.
However, the lack of cover and concealment exposes troops to increased hazards. Smooth sand is a good
reflector of nuclear thermal and blast effects; generating increased numbers of injuries. High temperatures
will increase the discomfort and debilitating effects on personnel wearing MOPP, especially heat injuries.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_3-17" id="Para_3-17"></a>3-17. Medical Evacuation in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> An NBC environment forces the unit leadership to consider to what extent he will commit
MEDEVAC assets to the contaminated area. If the battalion or task force is operating in a contaminated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-11" id="Page_3-11">[3-11]</a></span>
area, most or all of the organic medical platoon MEDEVAC assets will operate there. However, efforts
should be made to keep some ambulances free of contamination. For conventional MEDEVAC operations
see FM 8-10-6 and FM 8-10-26.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> We have three basic modes of evacuating patients (personnel [litter bearers], ground vehicles,
and aircraft). Using litter bearers to carry the patients involves a great deal of stress. Cumbersome MOPP
gear, added to climate, increased workload, and the fatigue of battle, will greatly reduce personnel
effectiveness. If personnel must enter a radiologically contaminated area, an OEG must be established (see
<a href="#TAB_3-1">Table 3-1</a>). Radiation exposure records are maintained by the NBC NCO and made available to the
commander, staff, and medical leader. The exposure is entered into the individual's medical record. Based
on the OEG, the commander and leaders will decide which MEDEVAC assets will be sent into the
contaminated area. Again, every effort is made to limit the number of MEDEVAC assets that are
contaminated. Medical evacuation considerations should include the following:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) A number of ambulances will become contaminated in the course of battle. Optimize the
use of resources; use those already contaminated (medical or nonmedical) before employing uncontaminated
resources.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Once a vehicle or aircraft has entered a contaminated area, it is highly unlikely that it can
be spared long enough to undergo thorough decontamination. However, operational decontamination
should be performed to the greatest extent possible. This will depend upon the contaminant, the tempo of
the battle, and the resources available to the MEDEVAC unit. Normally, contaminated vehicles (air and
ground) will be confined to dirty environments. See FM 3-5 for details on decontamination procedures.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Use ground ambulances instead of air ambulances in contaminated areas; they are more
plentiful, are easier to decontaminate, and are easier to replace. However, this does not preclude the use of
aircraft. If an air ambulance is deployed into a contaminated area, use it for repeated MEDEVAC missions
rather than sending other clean aircraft into the area.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) The relative positions of the contaminated area, forward line of own troops (FLOT), and
threat air defense systems will determine where helicopters may be used in the MEDEVAC process. One
or more helicopters may be restricted to contaminated areas; use ground vehicles to cross the line separating
clean and contaminated areas. The ground ambulance proceeds to an MTF with a patient decontamination
station (PDS); the patient is decontaminated and treated. If further MEDEVAC is required, a clean ground
or air ambulance is used. The routes used by ground vehicles to cross between contaminated and clean
areas are considered dirty routes and should not be crossed by clean vehicles, if mission permits. Consider
the effects of wind and time upon the contaminants; some agents will remain for extended periods of time.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Keep the helicopter rotor wash in mind when evacuating patients, especially in a
contaminated environment. The intense rotor wash will disturb the contaminants and further aggravate the
condition. The aircraft must be allowed to land and reduce to flat pitch before patients are brought near.
This will reduce the effects of the rotor wash. Additionally, a helicopter must not land too close to a
decontamination station (especially upwind) because any trace of contaminants in the rotor wash will
compromise the decontamination procedure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-12" id="Page_3-12">[3-12]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Immediate decontamination of rotor wing aircraft and ground vehicles is accomplished to
minimize crew exposure. Units include decontamination procedures in their standing operating procedures
(SOP). A sample aircraft decontamination station that may be tailored to a unit's needs is provided in FM 3-5.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Evacuation of patients must continue, even in an NBC environment. The HSS leader must
recognize the constraints NBC places on operations; then plan and train to overcome these deficiencies.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> To minimize the spread of contamination inside the MEDEVAC aircraft, plastic sheeting
should be placed under the litter to catch any contaminant that drips off the patient or litter. The plastic
sheeting can be removed with the patient, removing any contamination with it. When plastic sheeting is not
available, placing a blanket under the litter will reduce the amount of agent that makes contact with the
inside of the aircraft.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd60">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The key to mission success is detailed preplanning. A HSS plan must
be prepared for each support mission. Ensure that the HSS plan is in
concert with the tactical plan. Use the plan as a starting point and
improve on it while providing HSS.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Medical evacuation by United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft will be severely limited until
runway repairs and decontamination has occurred. Aerial flights from contaminated areas into
uncontaminated airspace and destinations may be impossible for extended periods of time; some nations will
not allow patients from contaminated areas to travel through or over their country. Therefore, patient
holding on-site (or in theater) for an extended period of time must be anticipated.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> Patient protection during evacuation must be maintained. Patients that have been decontaminated
at the PDS at an MTF will have had their MOPP ensemble removed. The forward deployed
MTFs will not have replacement MOPP ensembles for the patients. These patients must be placed in a
patient protective wrap (PPW) before they are removed from the clean treatment area for evacuation (see the
PPW instruction sheet/PPW label for use of the PPW). The PPW provides the same level of protection as
the MOPP ensemble. The patient does not have to wear a protective mask when inside the PPW. The patient
is placed inside the PPW that is on a litter. The PPW may also have a battery-operated blower that can
provide a reduction of the body heat load and reduce the carbon dioxide level within the PPW. The PPW
will provide protection for the patient for up to 6 hours and is a one-time use item. The blower is reusable,
remove it and the attachment devices from the used PPW and return it to the patient movement items
inventory. See FM 4-02.1 for a discussion on patient movement items.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">WARNING</p>

<p class="noindent">DO NOT place contaminated patients in the PPW. It is for
use with uncontaminated/decontaminated patients only.</p>

LEVELS III AND IV HOSPITALIZATION</h2>

<h4><a name="Para_4-1" id="Para_4-1"></a>4-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Many factors must be considered when planning for Levels III and IV hospital support on the
integrated battlefield. The hospital staff must be able to defend against threats by individuals or small
groups (two or three) of infiltrators and survive NBC strikes or TIM incidents while continuing their
mission. This threat may include the introduction of NBC or TIM in the hospital area, the water or food
supplies; and the destruction of equipment and/or supplies. On the larger scale of surviving NBC strikes
and continuing to support the mission, operating in a contaminated environment will present many problems
for hospital personnel. The use of NBC weapons or TIM release can compromise both the quality and
quantity of health care delivered by medical personnel due to the contamination at the MTF; constrain
mobility and evacuation; and contaminate the logistical supply base. While providing hospital support,
consider the following assumptions:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Their location, close to other support assets, makes them vulnerable to NBC strikes and
release/dispersion of TIMs.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) infrastructure,
logistical nodes, and base clusters are high value targets.</li>

<li>Most NBC weapons are designed for wide-area coverage. Chemical and biological
agents may present a hazard some distance downwind from the area of attack; also, residual radiation may
extend for hundreds of kilometers (km) from ground zero.</li>

<li>The large signature (size, heat, infrared) of a hospital makes it easy to find and
target (the assumption is that the hospital is very near the intended targets).</li>

<li>Hospitals located near road networks and airfields for access to evacuation routes
increase their exposure to tactical strikes of NBC weapons and exposure to TIM releases.</li>

<li>There are ever-increasing numbers of countries and individuals with the ability to
manufacture and deliver NBC weapons/agents. This activity increases their use potential at all levels of
conflict.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd60">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">When using existing civilian hospitals, the materials for an RDD may
be at these hospitals. Exploding the material in place is very practical
for a small team of terrorists.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-1">(2) Large numbers of casualties are produced in a short period of time. Many of these
casualties may have injuries that are unfamiliar to hospital personnel. These injuries may include&mdash;</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Radiation casualties.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-2" id="Page_4-2">[4-2]</a></span>
Biological casualties.</li>

<li>Chemical casualties.</li>

<li>Toxic industrial biological casualties (release of material from biological research facilities).</li>

<li>Toxic industrial chemical casualties.</li>

<li>Toxic industrial radiological casualties.</li>

<li>Chemical agent antidote overdose casualties.</li>

<li>Combined conventional and NBC injuries.</li>

<li>Stress casualties mimicking all the above.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(3) In addition to the wounding effects of NBC weapons on troops, their use will have other
effects upon the patient care delivery system.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Follow-on treatment may have to be delayed due to the need for patient and faculty
decontamination.</li>

<li>The arrival of contaminated patients at the hospital will require hospital personnel
to perform triage; administer EMT procedures in the patient decontamination area; supervise augmentation
personnel performing patient decontamination; and constantly monitor the hospital for contamination. The
combat support hospital [CSH] requires at least 20 nonmedical personnel from units within the geographic
area/base cluster of the hospital to perform patient decontamination under medical supervision. See
<a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for patient decontamination procedures.</li>

<li>Patients may have been triaged and decontaminated at a Level I or Level II MTF.
However, all patients must be triaged and checked for contamination as they arrive at the hospital ambulance
drop off point. Triage ensures patients receive life- or limb-saving care in a timely manner. If patients are
arriving from a suspected NBC contaminated area, they must be decontaminated before admission into the
clean treatment area of the hospital. The patient decontamination area is established on the downwind side
of the hospital. When the hospital does not have collective protection, the patient decontamination point
must be at least 50 yards downwind of the hospital entry point. When the hospital is located inside a base
cluster, the patient decontamination area may have to be established some distance from the hospital to
prevent contamination of other units in the area. Should this be the case, the patients may have to be
transported by ambulance or other vehicle from the clean side (hot line) of the patient decontamination area
to the receiving point of the hospital.</li>

<li>Conditions may mandate the use of nonmedical vehicles to transport casualties to
the MTF. The use of these vehicles limits or prohibits en route medical care, but may be the only way to
clear the battlefield and ensure timely care of patients at the hospital.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(4) Mission-oriented protective posture reduces the efficiency of all personnel.</p>

<p class="para-1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-3" id="Page_4-3">[4-3]</a></span>
(5) Without CPS systems, hospitals may operate for a limited time in a nonpersistent agent
environment, but are incapable of operating in a persistent agent environment.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Chemical/biological filters for fixed site hospital ventilation systems will be a critical
item of supply. Controlled entry and exit point with sufficient space to permit placement of litter patients
and/or numbers of personnel that permit purge of vapors will have to be established. All windows, doors,
and other points that may have air leaks will have to be sealed (use tape and plastic sheeting) to enable the
facility to have a positive overpressure to keep CB agents out.</li>

<li>Liquid chemical agents can penetrate the TEMPER in about 6 hours or general
purpose (GP) tentage in a shorter period of time. These agents will penetrate the wrappings on medical
supplies and equipment; especially, sterilized equipment and supplies, paper-wrapped cotton sponges, and
open or lightly closed medications/solutions. They can also contaminate water/food supplies. Therefore,
equipment and supplies must be stored in protected areas or under protective coverings.</li>

<li>Without a CPS system, treatment procedures involving open wounds or the
respiratory tract in the presence of a CB agent hazard is limited. Exposing open wounds and the respiratory
tract to the agent increases the effects of these agents on the patient.</li>

<li>Without hardened protection, the hospital, staff, and patients are susceptible to the
effects (blast, thermal, radiation, and missiling) of nuclear weapons.</li>

<li>Hospital electrical and electronic medical equipment is vulnerable to the effects of
the EMP produced by nuclear weapons. The EMP is not harmful to humans, animals, or plants, but is very
damaging to electronic equipment.</li>

<li>Hospital equipment is very difficult to decontaminate. Aging (allowing the agent to
off-gas) may be the only means of decontamination.</li>

<li>Hospitals are not kept in reserve. All personnel and equipment losses due to NBC
contamination or radiation will have to be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> There are currently two force modernization initiative hospital systems in the force structure.
The Medical Force 2000 (MF2K) system consists of the CSH, the field hospital (FH), and the general
hospital (GH). The Medical Reengineering Initiative (MRI) consists of only one hospital system&mdash;the CSH.
The MF2K CSH is a corps asset, whereas, the FH and GH are the echelon above corps hospital systems.
The MRI CSH will be located in the corps and at echelons above corps. The MRI CSH will replace the FH
and GH at echelons above corps. See FM 4-02.10, FM 8-10-14, and FM 8-10-15 for detailed information
on these hospital systems.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_4-2" id="Para_4-2"></a>4-2. Protection</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Protection of hospital assets requires intensive use of intelligence information and careful
planning. The limited mobility of hospitals makes their site selection vital to minimize collateral damage
from attacks on other units.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-4" id="Page_4-4">[4-4]</a></span>
Hospitals must be located as close to the supported units as possible to provide responsive
care in support of the tactical commander's plan. However, their limited mobility must be considered when
selecting their locations.</li>

<li>Protective factors (distance from other support units and interposed terrain features) must
be balanced against the operational factors (accessibility and time required for patient transport).</li>

<li>Depending on the weapon systems used, local topography, and meteorological conditions,
relatively large portions of the tactical area may remain uncontaminated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Many defensive measures will either impede or preclude performance of the hospital mission.
Successful hospital defense against an NBC threat is dependent upon accurate, timely receipt of information
via the nuclear, biological, and chemical warning and reporting system (NBCWRS). This information will
allow the hospital to operate longer without the limitations and problems associated with the use of the CPS
and personnel assuming MOPP Levels 3 and 4. The detailed information (provided in the NBC 5 and 6
reports respectively) on the areas affected and the types of agents used allows the hospital staff to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Project the number and types of patients to be expected.</li>

<li>Establish a patient decontamination area.</li>

<li>Request patient decontamination assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(1) <i>Protective procedures.</i></p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Because most hospital sections operate in sheltered areas (tentage or hard-walled
shelter), some protection is provided against vapor, liquid, and particulate (fallout) hazards. Sealing all
openings can increase the temporary protection from such hazards; all entries and exits must be curtailed
while operating in this mode. Liquid agents will eventually seep through the tent fabric and create a vapor
hazard inside the shelter. Locating equipment, such as trucks, under trees or other cover provides similar
effects. Setting up hospitals in existing structures (concrete or steel buildings) provides greater protection
from hazards and eliminates many decontamination problems. However, without means to seal openings,
chemical agent vapors can enter the structure. The addition of CB filtration systems with air locks, that
provide overpressure, can provide maximum protection for occupants. Entry and exit procedures must be
established to prevent contamination being introduced by personnel and patients entering. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a>
for entry/exit procedures when CB filters and air locks are in use.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Concealment and good operations security (OPSEC) will help prevent identification
of a unit.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Dispersion is a defensive measure employed by tactical commanders; however,
hospital operations limit the value of this technique. One technique that may be used is locating sections of
the hospital, such as the motor pool, personnel billets, laundry, and logistical storage, a greater distance
from the hospital complex than normal. This will increase dispersion without severely compromising the
hospital mission.</p>

<p class="para-aa"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-5" id="Page_4-5">[4-5]</a></span>
(<i>d</i>) The MOPP ensemble does not protect against all radiation effects of nuclear
weapons. However, it provides some protection against alpha and beta radiation burns. By covering all
body surfaces, especially hairy areas, MOPP greatly expedites the decontamination process.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <i>Nuclear.</i></p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Most protective measures for hospitals against nuclear attack require engineer and/or
intensive logistic support. This support includes placing sandbag walls around tents; digging trenches for
patient occupation; or constructing earthen berms (see <a href="#APP_H">Appendix H</a>). Occupying existing structures,
depending upon their strength and potential flammability, may be the best protection against the effects of a
nuclear strike. The remainder of this section presents factors to consider when selecting the protective
posture for the hospital against a nuclear attack. Leaving equipment packed and loaded until actually
needed for operations will help protect materiel in an NBC environment. In any event the unit must have
established an OEG, implemented radiation monitoring, and have contingency plans if these radiation levels
are approached or exceeded.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Personnel and patient protection requirements will depend upon the threat (blast,
thermal, immediate radiation, or fallout effects). The MOPP ensemble will not protect against internal
radiation, but will provide some protection from external radiological contamination.</p>

<ul class="pad6">
<li>If the threat is nuclear fallout, the hospital structure provides protection; the
fallout can be brushed or washed off. This allows protection while permitting patient care to continue
virtually uninterrupted. A need to relocate the hospital will depend upon the degree of contamination; the
amount of decontamination possible; and the projected stay before a normal move in support of operations.</li>

<li>Hospital tentage alone offers little protection against blast and missiling effects.
If the patients are to remain in the tents, they are placed on the floor. Place all equipment on the ground or
as low as possible and secure all loose objects. In GP tents, sandbags can be piled around the base of the
tent poles to add stability. The tent poles and patient beds should keep the canvas off the ground enough (if
the tent collapses) to continue minimal patient care and evacuation; however, be aware of possible tent pole
breakage.</li>

<li>Hospital units are very susceptible to the thermal effect of a nuclear detonation.
Tents will not provide protection against the thermal pulse. If the thermal effect (fire) is an impending
threat, patients and personnel in tentage must move to trenches, bunkers, or other nonflammable areas.</li>

<li>Protection factors that can reduce the overall radiation exposure rate for
hospital personnel and patients are&mdash;</li>

<li>Time. Reducing the exposure time to the radiation reduces the overall
exposure proportionally (cut the time of exposure in half and the overall exposure is cut in half).
EXAMPLE: An exposure time of 60 minutes to a dose rate of 100 centigray (cGy) is cut in half (30
minutes) to an exposure rate of 50 cGy.</li>

<li>Distance. Increasing the distance from the radiation source reduces the exposure
in an inverse square relationship (double the distance factor by 2 decreases the exposure factor by 4).</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-6" id="Page_4-6">[4-6]</a></span>
Shielding. Placing material between personnel and patient and the
radiation source decreases the dose (the reduction factor is dependent on the type of radiation and the
density of the shielding material). Placement of sandbags (two feet wide) around the hospital tents and
shelters provides adequate shielding for protection from gamma and x-ray radiation; the thicker the sandbag
stacks the greater the protection factor. Tent material is a good shield for alpha particles and adequate
shielding from beta particles. See <a href="#APP_H">Appendix H</a> for field expedient shielding techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(3) <i>Biological.</i> The most likely use of a biological agent (such as anthrax) is releasing the
agent as an aerosol. While such agents may produce large numbers of casualties, initially patients may be
seen at the MTF in small numbers, but the number of patients will rapidly increase within a few hours to
days. When a trend is identified, the enemy use of a biological agent is suspected. General protective
measures are the same as for any infectious disease; specific protective measures are used once the vector or
method of transmission has been identified. Designating a single hospital to care for these patients (from a
patient care or disease transmission standpoint) may not be necessary. However, if the agent is
communicable, consolidating them all at one facility maximizes the use of limited assets and aids in limiting
the spread of the disease. Protective measures against biological attack are the same as those for chemical
agents when bombs, sprays, or gases are used; see (4) below. The difficulty in rapidly identifying
biological agents may force the use of protective measures for longer periods of time. Faced with this
situation, a careful evaluation of the mask-only posture is necessary before implementing any level of
MOPP. See FM 8-284 for additional information on prevention, protection, and treatment of biological
casualties.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) <i>Chemical.</i></p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) <i>Individual protection.</i> When CPS systems are not available, using the correct
MOPP level is essential in hospital mission performance. The level of MOPP assumed depends upon the
level of threat. An alternative approach for the hospital commander is the use of the mask-only posture.
This posture is acceptable when the hazard is from vapor only (except mustard). See FM 3-4 for a
description of each MOPP level and mask-only procedures.</p>

<ul class="pad6">
<li><i>Hospital warning system.</i> The hospital must have a warning system that alerts
all personnel of impending or present hazards. This system must include visual and auditory signals; the
signals must operate inside and outside the hospital complex. There are numerous problems associated with
warning personnel; they include&mdash;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="pad8">
<li>The wide area covered by the hospital operations.</li>

<li>Some personnel will be asleep at all times of the day or night (two or
three shifts).</li>

<li>The considerable noise from mechanical support equipment; such as the
power generation and environmental control equipment.</li>

<li>Tentage and equipment interrupts line of sight.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="pad6">
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-7" id="Page_4-7">[4-7]</a></span>
<i>Hospital personnel response.</i> When NBC alarms are activated, all personnel
(including off duty personnel) report to their duty stations as soon as they are in the designated MOPP level.
This allows for 100 percent personnel accounting and provides additional personnel to secure patients and
materiel.</li>

<li><i>Unprotected hospital areas.</i> Areas of the hospital without CPS are at their
best posture with all openings secured and the ventilation systems turned off. For nonpersistent agents
(vapor hazards), personnel and patients stay at the designated MOPP level until the all clear signal is given;
then normal operations are resumed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd60">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Patients with injuries that prevent their assuming a protective posture
must be placed in a PPW or immediately evacuated to a clean MTF.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-aa"><i>(b) Environmental protection.</i> As noted previously, hospital complexes without CPS
offer some protection against liquid or fallout contamination, but little protection against vapor hazards.</p>

<ul class="pad6">
<li>When MOPP Level 1 must be assumed, close and secure all tent flaps, vents,
and doors to prevent the entrance of liquids or particles. All hospital personnel outside of shelters assume
MOPP Level 4. Cover or move all equipment and supplies into shelters (tents, hard-walled shipping
containers), if possible. Placement under thick foliage trees is better than left out in the open. The best
policy is to keep all equipment and supplies not immediately needed covered or in closed containers.</li>

<li>When MOPP Level 3 or mask-only posture is assumed, shut down the
hospital's ventilation system to prevent drawing vapors or fallout contamination into the hospital. This
measure also provides some protection of the internal environment during the time required for the vapor to
penetrate the tentage.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-aa"><i>(c) Patient protection.</i></p>

<ul class="pad6">
<li>Patient protection depends upon prior planning and timely warning of the
chemical threat. Each patient's protective mask must be available and serviceable. If the patient came from
a contaminated area, the mask must be decontaminated and the filters changed. The mask decontamination
and filter change may have to be performed by hospital personnel. If ambulatory patients' medical
conditions permit (minimal care ward), they may be able to perform this task. The hospital supply staff
must ensure that mask filters are available at the supporting logistics support facility and can be requisitioned
to meet this requirement. Check all masks for serviceability as soon as the mission permits, but always
before they are needed. Do not wait until the warning has been received to begin checking the mask. Each
area must have an established plan for operations (to include assisting patients assuming MOPP or other
protective posture) in the NBC environment. <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> provides additional information on patient
protection.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-8" id="Page_4-8">[4-8]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">CAUTION</p>

<p class="noindent">Remember, personnel must assume MOPP Level 4 before
beginning any decontamination process or risk becoming
a casualty themselves.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<ul class="pad6">
<li>Hospital staff always mask themselves first, then assist patients in masking.
On minimal care wards, most patients can put on their masks. For those who cannot, other patients can
assist them after putting on their own masks. On the intermediate care wards, some patients will be able to
put on their masks, but many will require assistance. Intensive care and emergency room staff will have to
assist their patients in masking.</li>

<li>Many patients with head and neck wounds or who are on life-support devices
will be unable to wear their individual protective masks; these patients must be placed in a PPW. While the
PPW has two ports for intravenous or blood infusion lines, the staff may have to adapt for other devices
(Foley catheters, traction devices, and cardiac monitor) by using tape and other means to seal the gaps
created in the seal around the edge of the PPW. Patients requiring assisted ventilation are at extreme risk,
unless their air supply is protected. The sequence of protecting everyone is mask yourself first; assist those
patients who can wear their protective masks; and then place patients in the PPW.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-aa"><i>(d) Materiel protection.</i> Protection of materiel, especially expendable supplies, requires
covers and barriers. All materiel not required for immediate use is kept in shipping containers, medical
chests, or under cover (tentage, plastic sheeting, and tarpaulin) for protection against particulate or liquid
hazard. Protection against vapor hazard may require multiple barriers through which the vapor must
penetrate. For example, intravenous solutions are in their individual plastic bags, in the cardboard shipping
box, on a covered pallet, in a hard-walled shelter; such as a military-owned demountable container
(MILVAN). This presents four barriers against the vapor hazard. These principles should be used to the
maximum extent practical.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_4-3" id="Para_4-3"></a>4-3. Decontamination</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Decontamination of nuclear-contaminated personnel, equipment, and the operational site is as
follows:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Monitoring equipment is used to detect contamination; the contamination is then removed
by brushing or scraping with brooms, brushes, or tree branches. Flushing hard surface contaminated areas
with water <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'are also'">is also</ins> effective in removing nuclear contamination. However, there remains a problem of
containing and removing the contaminated water. The best method of containment is to trench the area into
a sump for collection of the contamination. This will reduce the area of contamination; however, the level
of concentrated radiation may be such that there is an increased hazard to personnel. The collection area
must be clearly marked using the standard nuclear hazard signs.</p>

<p class="para-1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-9" id="Page_4-9">[4-9]</a></span>
(2) Nuclear contamination of the site may require relocating the hospital. Scraping 1 or 2
inches of topsoil from the area, or covering the area with 1 or 2 inches of uncontaminated dirt will not be
practical. A need to relocate the hospital will depend upon the degree of contamination; the amount of
decontamination possible and the projected stay before a normal move in support of operations. If the
hospital is immersed in a high level of radioactivity, the best option may be to abandon it for 48 to 72 hours.
After this period the area should be checked and if the radioactivity has decayed sufficiently the hospital
may be reoccupied and continue operations or moved to a clean area. The command OEG must be followed
if reoccupying or moving the facility.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Suspect biological agents should be removed from equipment as quickly as possible, In the
absence of agent-specific guidance, clean exposed surfaces using a 5 percent hypochlorite solution or
copious quantities of soap and water (preferably hot). Liberally apply the hot, soapy water and scrub all
surfaces with a brush. Then rinse the surfaces with hot water. As previously discussed, the soapy water
used is contaminated and must be controlled and removed to a safe area. Supertropical bleach (STB) and
decontaminating solution Number 2 (DS2, US Army) are effective against most known biological agents
because of their caustic nature. If anthrax (or other spore formers) is suspected, repeat the entire
decontamination process again to remove the spores. Other standard biological decontamination agents are
described in FM 3-5.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">CAUTION</p>

<p class="noindent">1. Keep liquid decontaminants out of equipment with electronic
or electrical circuits. Unplug electrical devices before attempting
to decontaminate them; prevent electric shock. Some electronic
devices maintain an electric charge, even after being unplugged,
use extreme care to prevent shock.<br />
<br />
2. Soap and water only mechanically remove BW agents. The
soap and water solution must be contained to prevent spreading
the agent to other personnel, thus causing more casualties.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Decontamination of chemical contamination is as follows:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Personnel use their soldier skills and their M295 Individual Equipment Decontamination
Kit to decontaminate their personal equipment. The M13, decontamination apparatus, portable, is used to
decontaminate vehicles, trailers, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) shelters. This
apparatus uses DS2 (a highly caustic, flammable solution that cannot be used to decontaminate tentage).
The DS2 must be washed off after sufficient time has passed for decontamination (see FM 3-5 for details).
Water used for NBC decontamination purposes becomes contaminated; therefore, it must be contained in
sumps. Dig shallow trenches to channel the water into sumps. This will be difficult in hospital areas
because relatively flat sites are needed for hospital complexing, but must be accomplished to reduce the
contamination levels in the hospital area.</p>

<p class="para-1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-10" id="Page_4-10">[4-10]</a></span>
(2) When hospital tentage becomes contaminated, decontamination operations must be
considered immediately. Spot decontamination may be effective for small areas; however, gross
contamination of TEMPER and GP tentage is best decontaminated by aging. Without CPS and with
persistent agent contamination that absorbs into the tentage and presents a continuing vapor hazard, the
hospital stops receiving patients and evacuates all patients as quickly as possible. When large portions of
the hospital are contaminated, personnel decontaminate all equipment possible and relocate to a new site,
leaving the contaminated equipment to age or to be decontaminated by a specialized unit. When small
portions of the hospital are contaminated, the contaminated portions are removed to another location for
decontamination; hospital operations are continued, but at a lower operational level. For detailed equipment
decontamination procedures, see FM 3-5.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Liquid decontamination material must not be used on electrical or
electronic components of equipment. Liquid decontaminants can
damage the equipment; thus making it inoperable and not available for
patient care or transport. The use of liquids to decontaminate
electronic equipment could also potentially result in injury or electrocution
of personnel.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-1">(3) Each US Army hospital is issued <b>five</b> chemical agent patient treatment MES and <b>three</b>
chemical agent patient decontamination MES, Chemical Agents Patient Decontamination, for use in
decontaminating patients. Each hospital must decontaminate and treat its own personnel who become
casualties; chemical casualties from units in its general area; or contaminated patients received from lower
level MTFs. See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for patient decontamination procedures and for establishment of a patient
decontamination and treatment station.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_4-4" id="Para_4-4"></a>4-4. Emergency Services</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Providing emergency services will be complicated by several factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Varying levels of treatment received prior to arrival at the hospital.</li>

<li>Caring for combined conventional wounds and NBC agent effects.</li>

<li>Managing heat-related complications associated with MOPP/PPW use.</li>

<li>Controlling psychological effects caused by biological and chemical agents, the impact of
NBC weapons, or the isolation of MOPP gear or PPWs.</li>

<li>Having EMT personnel working at the arrival point, decontamination site, and in the

Conducting triage and providing patient care while in MOPP gear.</li>

<li>Supervising supported units decontamination augmentation personnel. These personnel
will most likely be of any military occupational specially (MOS), except medical. They will use hospital
equipment and supplies to decontaminate patients.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Contaminated patients must be triaged in the decontamination area that is established at the
hospital. Contaminated patients <b>WILL NOT</b> be brought into the clean EMT area until decontaminated. All
patients are screened for contamination. Based on the findings, the patient is routed to the contaminated
triage station, or to the clean triage station. Contaminated patients are triaged, then routed to the decontamination
area, or to the contaminated treatment area. Patient admission to the clean treatment area may
be delayed; however, life- or limb-saving care is provided in the contaminated treatment area before
decontamination.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_4-5" id="Para_4-5"></a>4-5. General Medical Services</h4>

<p class="noindent">The provision of general medical services in the hospital will be continued with minimal interruptions in the
NBC environment. The noninvasive nature of these services allows their continuation at most MOPP
levels. However, some general medical services will be constrained by MOPP Levels 3 and 4 and the
mask-only posture. These constraints may include, but not be limited to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication limitations.</li>

<li>Loss of the oral route for administering medications to patients.</li>

<li>Limited ability to accurately evaluate the eyes, nose, and mouth of patients wearing a protective
mask.</li>

<li>Reduced ability to perform examination/assessment of patients in PPW or MOPP Levels 3 and 4.</li>

<li>Inability to provide oxygen therapy or ventilator support to a patient in a vapor hazard
environment, unless a CB filter-supported respirator is available.</li>

<li>Logistical constraints based upon the fact that key areas such as dietetics, supply, and laundry
are not in the CPS. These services may be reduced or delayed in the NBC environment. See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a>
for Information on patient feeding under NBC conditions.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_4-6" id="Para_4-6"></a>4-6. Surgical Services</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Surgical services will be severely limited in the NBC environment. At any level above MOPP
Level 0, without a CPS system surgical services are halted except for life- or limb-saving expedient
procedures. Surgery cannot be safely performed outside a CPS due to a variety of factors including&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-12" id="Page_4-12">[4-12]</a></span>
Lack of protected ventilation for patients during and after surgery.</li>

<li>Inability to maintain a sterile field while using MOPP gear.</li>

<li>Direct access for agents through open wounds to the circulatory and respiratory systems.</li>

<li>Decreased dexterity and vision resulting from MOPP gear use.</li>

<li>Inability to quickly place the patient in a PPW should the need arise.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Due to the relatively high number of trauma cases, hospital services may be severely
constrained by NBC contamination. The hospital location and the possible need for relocation are two
major planning considerations for the command staff.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Patient accounting and medical regulating are critical factors in the transfer of patients from a
hospital without a CPS that must move out of an NBC environment. Hospitals without CPS stop receiving
patients when a persistent hazard is identified; patients on hand are protected and transferred to a clean
MTF.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_4-7" id="Para_4-7"></a>4-7. Nursing Services</h4>

<p class="noindent">Providing nursing care in a hospital without CPS is influenced by the amount of protective gear worn by the
nursing staff and the patients. The patients may be in their MOPP gear, in a PPW, or wearing only their
protective mask; any of which will interfere with care. The nursing staff will wear the same level of
protection as the patients.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Direct assessment of a patient's vital signs is extremely limited at MOPP Levels 3 or 4;
however, a carotid artery pulse can be taken by palpating the neck area. The patient's respiratory rate and
level of consciousness may be assessed visually. Palpitation of the blood pressure through a PPW may be
possible if it is relatively strong, or at least in the normal range. The patient's temperature cannot be
monitored; this is an area of concern due to the possibility of heat stress.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Only gross neurological signs can be assessed through the PPW or when the patient is in
MOPP Levels 3 or 4. However, even this assessment is complicated by the presence of miosis and by the
health care provider's mask. Urinary output and cardiac monitoring is continued uninterrupted for patients
wearing a mask only and for patients in the PPW.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Oral hygiene and bathing are postponed until a safe environment is available (MOPP Level 2
or less). All toileting will occur within the hospital complex using ISO contained latrines, chemical toilets,
bedpans, urinals, buckets, or containers with plastic liners. Waste from improvised containers must be
placed in containers with covers or in plastic bags and sealed to control odors and prevent spread of
infectious material within the facility.</p>

<p class="para-a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-13" id="Page_4-13">[4-13]</a></span>
<i>d.</i> At MOPP Levels 3 and 4, feeding must be postponed. A nutritional assessment is needed to
determine how long each patient can tolerate a fasting state when MOPP Level 3 or Level 4 remains in
effect for over 24 hours.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Intravenous (IV) medications are mixed in a clean area and then transported in a protective
wrap (multilayers of plastic, medical chest, or layered cardboard) to the user. However, IV solutions,
blood, and injections can be given to patients on an unprotected ward. Normally, oral medications are only
given at MOPP Level 2 or lower.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Treatment procedures that have the potential of contaminating the patient's pulmonary or
circulatory systems are conducted only at MOPP Level 2 or below. However, EMT procedures may have
to be performed in the contaminated treatment area, or the patient decontamination area.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> Continuous oxygen therapy requires a collective protection environment or a CB filter
supported respirator.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> Delivery of nursing care at MOPP Level 3 or Level 4 is limited due to the sensory restrictions
of MOPP gear. Time is taken to reassure the patients on a personal basis, as much as possible, and by
routinely monitoring the ward environment. Communications are difficult and identities are masked.
Maintain the identity of personnel by using handwritten name tags for staff and patients (including patients
in PPW).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>i.</i> As with all procedures, the time required for record-keeping rises markedly at MOPP Level 3
or Level 4. Contaminated paperwork cannot be evacuated with the patient. Transcribe essential information
onto uncontaminated documents for evacuation with the patient. A record of patient exposure time to a
contaminated area is prepared to assess the cumulative risk to the patient.</p>

OTHER HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT</h2>

<h3>Section I. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SERVICES</h3>

<h4><a name="Para_5-1" id="Para_5-1"></a>5-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">On the integrated battlefield, PVNTMED services will be in greater demand than at any other time,
especially under BW conditions. Preventive medicine personnel will be called upon to assist the commander
in determining the health hazards associated with nuclear fallout; the safety of drinking water in an NBC
environment; as well as determining when to use prophylaxis, pretreatments, immunizations, and other
PVNTMED measures (PMM) associated with NBC warfare. Preventive medicine personnel must be aware
of the medical threat in the AO. They must continually update their medical surveillance activities to
identify disease trends (endemic and epidemic), potential disease vectors, and the susceptibility of troops to
these diseases. Under NBC conditions, diseases may manifest that exist in the area, but were not being
transmitted to personnel. However, due to the reduced health status of personnel from exposures to or from
stress-related NBC conditions, the troops begin to suffer their effects. The appearance of diseases or
arthropods not known to exist in the AO are indicators that BW agents have been used. For details on
PVNTMED operations, see FM 4-02.17.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-2" id="Para_5-2"></a>5-2. Disease Incidence Following the Use of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Determining Factors.</i> Factors of prime importance in determining the nature and severity of
the disease effects are&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Immunization status of personnel.</li>

<li>Population density.</li>

<li>Degree of industrialization in the operational area.</li>

<li>Availability of food supplies.</li>

<li>Availability of water.</li>

<li>Climate.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Finally, the manner and situation in which nuclear weapons are used are of importance. A single weapon
detonated in a socially stable area will have far less serious effects than a detonation in an area where
combat has already disrupted the social stability. At Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan (excellent examples of
the first type of situation), the survivors who could get away were able to obtain food, shelter, and care
from surrounding intact areas. With prolonged combat operations, such intact areas would not be available,
resulting in no food, shelter, or care for survivors. There will be a breakdown in social order and there will
be a lack of effective medical support; including PVNTMED functions and facilities.</p>

<p class="para-a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-2" id="Page_5-2">[5-2]</a></span>
<i>b.</i> <i>Disease Incidence.</i> Without PVNTMED capabilities, increased incidence and morbidity from
diseases will follow. Some diseases will predominate in incidence, depending upon the geographical areas
involved and the endemic diseases present.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) In urban areas in temperate climates, several diseases are epidemic threats. These
epidemic threats may include&mdash;</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Dysentery (due to a variety of pathogens).</li>

<li>Rickettsial diseases, particularly typhus and scrub typhus.</li>

<li>Hepatitis.</li>

<li>Tuberculosis.</li>

<li>Sexually transmitted diseases.</li>

<li>Malaria and cholera (in many parts of the world).</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(2) There are several reasons for the increased risk of disease including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Crowding of surviving populations with limited sanitary facilities, such as was seen
in Europe at the end of World War II.</li>

<li>A lack of prophylaxis and immunizations with resultant increases in the susceptible
faction of a given population.</li>

<li>A lack of pest management.</li>

<li>The effect of irradiation on susceptibility to infection. With the high levels of
fallout covering wide areas, a large number of people will sustain sublethal whole-body doses of irradiation.
The interaction of irradiation with infections is not clear; but it may be the result of latent infections
manifesting and decreased resistance to infection. The result is an increased incidence of disease.</li>

<li>The ecological imbalance and host-parasite relationship following the use of nuclear
weapons. Each class and order of animals has marked differences in sensitivity to irradiation. Arthropods,
for example, are much more resistant than are vertebrates. The normal balance between arthropods and
birds that prey upon them in a given area may be severely upset, producing a marked overgrowth of the
arthropods. If the arthropods include vectors of disease there would be a serious increase in disease
hazards. If there is an increase in arthropods that destroy vegetation there would be a serious destruction of
food crops.</li>

<li>The introduction of a BW agent in an AO in which the disease organism is endemic
or epidemic can increase the risk level for exposed personnel.</li>

<h4><a name="Para_5-3" id="Para_5-3"></a>5-3. Preventive Medicine Section</h4>

<p class="noindent">The PVNTMED sections of the brigade, divisional, and nondivisional medical companies perform analysis
on water sources and supplies to determine the presence or absence of NBC/TIM contamination; see
<a href="#APP_I">Appendix I</a> for additional information. Based upon their findings, the water is released for consumption, or
is restricted from use until it is treated (usually by water production personnel using the reverse osmosis
water purification unit [ROWPU]). They also collect water samples for suspect biological agent contamination
for supporting medical laboratory analysis (see <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a>). They conduct medical surveillance activities, to
include occupational and environmental health threat surveillance. They conduct limited entomological
surveys to determine the existence of disease-vectoring arthropods in the AO. They inspect food service

<h3>Section II. VETERINARY SERVICES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-5" id="Para_5-5"></a>5-5. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">The US Army Veterinary Service is the Executive Agent for veterinary services to all Services within the
DOD. They ensure that food and bottled water supplies are safe and provide veterinary medical and
surgical care for government-owned animals throughout the AO. On the integrated battlefield, their role is
particularly important; the potential for food supplies becoming contaminated with NBC agents is high. For
detailed information on provision of veterinary services see FM 8-10-18.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-6" id="Para_5-6"></a>5-6. Food Protection</h4>

<p class="noindent">Food may become contaminated from enemy employment of NBC weapons/agents or from terroristic
contamination of food procurement facilities and food supplies. The NBC agents may be introduced during
production or in the storage area of the procurement facility; while the product is in transit; at the military
storage facility; or at the unit food service facility. Regardless of where the agent is used, the effect is the
same; personnel will become ill or die if they consume the contaminated food. To ensure food safety,
veterinary personnel inspect and monitor food from its procurement until it is issued to the consumer.
Throughout the AO, all Services (Army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force) logistics and food service personnel
must take precautions to protect subsistence from contamination.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-7" id="Para_5-7"></a>5-7. Food Decontamination</h4>

<p class="noindent">Veterinary personnel are involved in the detection and monitoring of NBC contaminated rations; before
use, they must inspect all food suspected of being contaminated with NBC agents. <a href="#APP_J">Appendix J</a> provides
guidance on food decontamination procedures. Veterinary personnel provide advice on the decontamination
of food to unit personnel owning the food, or personnel performing the food decontamination. Depending
on the type of contamination and packaging, the food may be&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumed without being decontaminated.</li>

<li>Decontaminated and then consumed.</li>

<li>Destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Some items may be held to allow time for natural decay of nuclear or chemical contamination before
consumption. The commander, with advice from veterinary personnel, makes the decision on the disposition
of the food. However, veterinary personnel make the final determination of food safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-5" id="Page_5-5">[5-5]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_5-8" id="Para_5-8"></a>5-8. Animal Care</h4>

<p class="noindent">Veterinary personnel are concerned with the protection of government-owned animals and animals being
procured for consumption. Animals must be protected from NBC contamination, whenever possible.
Animals should be moved into enclosures to protect them as much as possible from contamination. Protective
equipment is not available for military working dogs; however, protection of the animal's feet and body
must be considered. When military working dogs must cross a contaminated area, protect their feet by
using butyl rubber material to improvise booties. Since CPS systems are not available, animal treatment
facilities must be established in contamination free areas. Veterinary treatment personnel must remain in
MOPP Level 4 when caring for NBC animal casualties until the animals have been decontaminated. The
treatment of military working dog NBC casualties is outlined in FM 8-10-18.</p>


<h3>Section III. LABORATORY SERVICES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-9" id="Para_5-9"></a>5-9. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">Laboratory services must continue their support role even under NBC conditions. For the provision of
clinical and diagnostic support, the facility must be located in a contamination-free area or be inside
collective protection. Designated laboratories within the theater will analyze NBC samples/specimens
(including in theater field confirmation identification of biological agents by evaluating specimens from
symptomatic patients and animals and environmental samples collected from the AO). See <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for
procedures in collecting biological samples/specimens, handling/packaging, maintaining chain of custody,
transporting samples/specimens, and analysis.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-10" id="Para_5-10"></a>5-10. Level II</h4>

<p class="noindent">Laboratory support at this level is extremely limited; it consists of laboratory procedures in direct support of
MTF and FST activities. Laboratory personnel prepare collected suspect NBC specimens for submission to
the supporting laboratory for analysis; the specimens are forwarded to supporting medical laboratories
(<a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a>).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-11" id="Para_5-11"></a>5-11. Level III</h4>

<p class="noindent">Laboratory support in a CSH is intended for providing clinical laboratory support and is primarily in
support of acute surgical cases, blood services, and statim (STAT) services required for intensive care
operations. Only extremely limited microbiology services (parasitological exams and gram stains) are
provided. In a mature theater, the microbiology services may be augmented to include limited cultures and
sensitivity testing. Patients with documented or suspected exposure to NBC weapons/agents will be
medically evaluated, specimens will be collected, packaged, and have chain of custody established. The
specimens will be forwarded through technical channels to the supporting medical laboratory (such as the
theater Army medical laboratory [TAML]) for analysis. See <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for specimen collection, packaging,
chain of custody, and processing requirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-6" id="Page_5-6">[5-6]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_5-12" id="Para_5-12"></a>5-12. Level IV</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Clinical Laboratories.</i> The clinical laboratories in the combat support, field, and general
hospitals have the ability to perform a general, but limited, array of analytical procedures in hematology,
urinalysis, chemistry, microbiology, serology, and blood bank. Patient specimens of suspected biological
or chemical agent exposures are forwarded through technical channels to the supporting medical laboratory.
See <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for sample/specimen collection, packaging, chain of custody, processing, and transporting
requirements.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Field Laboratories.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <i>Theater Army Medical Laboratory.</i> The TAML is the specialized echelons above corps
(EAC) laboratory that provides clinical and nonclinical medical laboratory support. When equipped and
staffed, the TAML provides in-theater field confirmation identification of NBC samples or specimens.
Using sophisticated equipment and methods, the TAML has the capability to detect and identify NBC agents
in a variety of specimens/samples (such as human, air, soil, water, animals, vegetation, and food). Direct
support from continental United States (CONUS)-based laboratories aids the TAML with identification of
NBC agents. Command decision on use of protective/preventive measures and patient care may be based
on the TAML findings. Proper collection, packaging, and rapid shipment of specimens by MTFs and
samples from other sources will ensure effective, timely, and accurate laboratory analyses.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <i>Area Medical Laboratory.</i> The Area Medical Laboratory (AML) is the specialized
laboratory within the theater that provides nonclinical medical laboratory support. The AML can be
deployed in the corps or to EAC for support missions. When fielded, the AML will replace the TAML in
the force structure. The AML provides in-theater field confirmation identification of NBC samples or
specimens. Using sophisticated equipment and methods, the AML has the capability to detect and identify
NBC agents in a variety of specimens/samples (such as human, air, soil, water, animals, vegetation, and
food). Direct support from CONUS-based laboratories aids the AML with identification of NBC agents.
Command decision on use of protective/preventive measures and patient care may be based on the AML
findings. Proper collection, packaging, and rapid shipment of specimens by MTFs and samples from other
sources will ensure effective, timely, and accurate laboratory analyses.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-13" id="Para_5-13"></a>5-13. Level V (Continental United States)</h4>

<p class="noindent">Designated Level V medical laboratories perform analyses to provide definitive identification of suspect
biological agents for the President and Secretary of Defense purposes. The definitive identification of
suspect biological agents also aids commanders in the AO in maintaining the health of their command.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-14" id="Para_5-14"></a>5-14. Field Samples</h4>

<p class="noindent">Chemical corps personnel collect environmental, air, soil, and vegetation samples. Preventive medicine
personnel collect samples from drinking water sources and supplies. Veterinary personnel collect samples
from food supplies and medical specimens from animals. All other units collect soil, vegetation, and small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-7" id="Page_5-7">[5-7]</a></span>
animal samples for laboratory analysis. Samples are subjected to initial screening with rapid test kits and in-theater
confirmatory identification at the supporting medical laboratory. The President- and Secretary of
Defense-required definitive identification is performed at the designated Level V medical laboratory.
Comprehensive databases will be maintained to provide historical testing results and will aid in the AO
commander's decisions to conduct operations in an NBC environment. See <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for specific
procedures for sample collection, packaging, transporting, maintaining chain of custody, and analysis.</p>


<h3>Section IV. DENTAL SERVICES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-15" id="Para_5-15"></a>5-15. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">Dental service support is provided in the AO at Levels II, III, and IV. Because of their location close to
main supply routes and other support assets, dental units are vulnerable to an NBC strike. Nuclear,
biological, and chemical operations have an impact at all levels; thus, dental units must be prepared to
survive on the integrated battlefield. Defense against NBC weapons must be included in the dental unit's
TSOP. Individual and collective tasks must be intensely trained on a regular basis; survival depends on the
ability of personnel to use basic survival skills against an NBC attack. For details on provision of dental
services, see FM 4-02.19.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-16" id="Para_5-16"></a>5-16. Mission in a Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical Environment</h4>

<p class="noindent">The overall mission of dental units to provide dental services is greatly affected in the aftermath of an NBC
attack. First, the unit must survive the attack and rapidly recover from its effects. Secondly, in the event of
mass casualties, the dental patient care effort must be redirected from dental treatment to the alternate
wartime role of augmenting the adjacent MTF. Dental units do not possess CPS; therefore, providing
dental services in an NBC environment will be limited to the treatment of maxillofacial emergencies
requiring immediate attention. This care will be provided at an MTF with a CPS.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-17" id="Para_5-17"></a>5-17. Dental Treatment Operations</h4>

<p class="noindent">As a general rule, in the aftermath of an NBC attack, dental treatment operations cease until deliberate
decontamination of the unit and its equipment has been accomplished. Only maxillofacial injuries of an
immediate life-threatening nature should be considered for treatment. After an attack, the resources of the
dental treatment facility (DTF) are redirected toward support of any mass casualty situation that may have
been generated at an adjacent MTF, or toward decontamination and relocation to a noncontaminated area.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-18" id="Para_5-18"></a>5-18. Patient Treatment Considerations</h4>

<p class="noindent">The only category of dental treatment appropriate in an NBC environment is emergency; and then, only
those emergencies of an extreme nature which demand immediate attention. The most likely condition
requiring such attention would be maxillofacial trauma and would most likely be treated at an MTF rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-8" id="Page_5-8">[5-8]</a></span>
than a DTF. Although the likelihood of a requirement to treat dental patients in an NBC environment is
extremely low, DTFs must have a plan in the event that such patients do present.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Patient Decontamination.</i> Decontamination of patients, dental patients included, is an absolute
requirement before admission into a clean MTF. Contaminated patients are triaged and decontaminated
before treatment (except for life- or limb-saving care). Both triage and decontamination should be
accomplished as far forward as possible. Specific details on patient decontamination are in <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a>. It
is important to note that normally patient decontamination is not performed by medical or dental personnel.
Initial decontamination at the basic skill level is accomplished at the casualty's unit. Detailed patient
decontamination is accomplished by the patient decontamination teams (made up of nonmedical personnel
from the supported units) that are supervised by medical personnel at the MTF.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Patient Decontamination at Dental Treatment Facilities.</i> Neither dental units nor their DTFs
are equipped for patient decontamination. Any contaminated patients arriving at a DTF requiring urgent
attention must be directed or evacuated to the nearest MTF with a patient decontamination capability.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-19" id="Para_5-19"></a>5-19. Patient Protection</h4>

<p class="noindent">Dental treatment facilities must also consider the need to protect patients in their care in the event of an
NBC attack, or when the threat of an attack is high. Special consideration must be made for maxillofacial
patients whose condition prevents them from wearing their protective mask.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Immediate Response.</i> In the event of an attack or when the alarm sounds, dental treatment
providers immediately cease work and mask. The patients should do likewise. Only after putting on their
own masks, do the dental treatment providers assist the patient, if necessary, by removing materials that
impede the patient's masking. Only those materials that impede masking or may compromise the airway
(such as rubber dam frames or impressions) are removed, the rest are left in place until the all clear is
sounded. Special attention must be given to patients who may have been medicated into a less than fully
conscious state, or are otherwise incapacitated.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Mission-Oriented Protective Posture Considerations.</i> The MOPP level should be taken into
account when determining the category and extent of dental treatment to be provided. Patients, including
those seated in the dental chair, should be at the MOPP level prescribed for the DTF by its parent
headquarters. Dental treatment at MOPP Levels 3 and 4 is, of course, impossible because of the requirement
to wear the protective mask; however, treatment is still possible at MOPP Levels 0, 1, and 2. Treatment at
MOPP Level 2 should be limited only to emergency care requiring urgent attention. At MOPP Level 1,
most types of dental emergencies can be accommodated; however, only minimal essential treatment should
be undertaken in order to reduce risk of the patient being caught in a compromised state. At MOPP Level 0,
the provision of dental treatment generally is not limited. However, the degree of the NBC threat forecast
for the area should be considered before undertaking extensive treatment.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Maxillofacial Injuries.</i> Patients with maxillofacial injuries that prevent proper fit and seal of
the individual protective mask must be placed in a PPW. Though patients with these types of injuries are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-9" id="Page_5-9">[5-9]</a></span>
most likely to be found only in MTF channels, DTFs should nevertheless be prepared in the event a patient
presents to the DTF. Since the DTF does not have any PPWs; these patients should be immediately
evacuated to the adjacent MTF for treatment.</p>


<h3>Section V. COMBAT OPERATIONAL STRESS CONTROL</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-20" id="Para_5-20"></a>5-20. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">When operating under the threat of or under actual NBC conditions, soldiers will be at a high risk of suffering
combat operational stress-related conditions. The invisible, pervasive nature of these weapons creates a
higher degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, presenting fertile opportunities for false alarms, mass panic,
and other maladaptive stress reactions. Therefore, commanders and leaders must take actions to prevent and
reduce the numbers of combat operational stress cases in this environment. The symptoms and physical signs
caused by excessive stress are similar to some signs of true NBC agent injury. In World War I, inexperienced
units initially evacuated two stress cases for every one true chemical casualty. Some minor chemical
casualties also had major stress symptoms. Therefore, far forward triage is essential to prevent over evacuation
and loss of the individual to the unit. For details on provision of COSC see FM 8-51 and FM 22-51.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-21" id="Para_5-21"></a>5-21. Leadership Actions</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Keep Personnel Informed of the Situation.</i> Keep information flowing, dispel myths, and
control rumors by&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussing the situation and its possible long-term implications honestly.</li>

<li>Maintaining the perspective that the best chance for mission accomplishment is assured
when the unit and the Army stays mission focused.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Train Soldiers to Survive.</i> Use training procedures that&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Tell the lessons of history on NBC weapons employment. Show that the enemy's use of
NBC weapons/agents will not give him enough advantage to justify the risk to his forces.</li>

<li>Increase the chance of surviving and winning should the enemy use NBC weapons/agents.</li>

<li>Emphasize the buddy system as a means of keeping watch for each other. Personnel
must always seek buddy aid before taking additional antidotes. This will reduce the numbers of individuals
using their antidotes when not needed; and prevent the increased heat stress caused by the effects of atropine
on the body's cooling capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-10" id="Page_5-10">[5-10]</a></span>
<i>c.</i> <i>Put Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense in Realistic Perspective.</i> Continuously strive
to maintain a realistic perspective in the unit by&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Comparing the risks of the threat with the increased risk of facing the conventional threat
in varying levels of MOPP. The decision to initiate a MOPP level should be like deciding how much cover
is needed to protect a unit from conventional weapons.</li>

<li>Choosing the lowest MOPP level that protects the unit, yet permits accomplishment of
the mission. Do not try to be 100 percent safe from chemical attack if it means that there is&mdash;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Only a small chance of mission accomplishment.</li>

<li>A high probability of being killed by the enemy.</li>

<li>A high personnel loss due to heat injury.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Train in the Protective Mask.</i> Train in the protective mask often. It takes repeated wear and
time to acclimate and get over the claustrophobic feeling of wearing the mask. The training can be
conducted during a variety of activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have personnel wear the mask often in garrison or during lulls in other activities, even at
desk jobs. If on average, one person in five wears the mask, on a rotational basis, at any given time,
everyone will quickly become accustomed to wearing it.</li>

<li>Periodic prolonged wear (8 hours or more) helps soldiers gain confidence and realize
that they can tolerate the discomfort.</li>

<li>Have personnel wear the mask while performing combat-related (mission essential) tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <i>Train in Mission-Oriented Protective Posture Level 4.</i> Training in MOPP Level 4 (or simulated
MOPP 4, which is to overdress while wearing the protective mask, overboots, and gloves) will increase
personnel confidence in their ability to wear the ensemble.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> <i>Ensure Sleep Plans are Safely Practiced.</i> Have everyone practice wearing the mask while
sleeping. Ensure personnel only sleep in safe places; do not allow personnel to sleep under or near vehicles
or other motorized machinery. Require ground guides for all vehicles in the unit bivouac area. Ensure that
each individual get at least 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep during every 24-hour period, mission permitting
(See FM 21-10).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-22" id="Para_5-22"></a>5-22. Individual Responsibilities</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Follow Orders.</i> By following orders, individuals can increase their ability to cope with and
prevent combat operational stress-related conditions. Coping with the stresses of an NBC environment requires
extra individual action. Concentrate on the positive aspects of survival, not the negatives of illness or death.</p>

<p class="para-a"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-11" id="Page_5-11">[5-11]</a></span>
<i>b.</i> <i>Train.</i> Use every opportunity to wear the protective mask or the entire MOPP ensemble
during training, when permitted. You build self-confidence and endurance by frequently training with your
protective mask, or at MOPP Level 4. Perform refresher training in basic NBC survival skills.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Use Buddy System.</i> Use the buddy system to increase your ability to survive. Service
members looking out for each other give a sense of security that relieves stress. Looking out for each other
improves every individual's ability to perform his duties.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-23" id="Para_5-23"></a>5-23. Mental Health Personnel Responsibilities</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Staffing for Combat Operational Stress Control.</i> Combat operational stress control is provided
by the following activities or units:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brigade mental health section.</li>

<li>Division mental health section.</li>

<li>Area support medical battalion mental health section.</li>

<li>Neuropsychiatric ward and consultation service of each CSH, field hospital, and general
hospital.</li>

<li>Medical detachment, COSC.</li>

<li>Medical company, COSC.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Conduct Preventive Activities.</i> In an NBC environment, prevention is the most economical
means of controlling combat operational stress reactions. Mental health personnel must begin consultation
services before NBC weapons/agents have been employed.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Control Stress Reactions.</i> Individuals with combat operational stress reactions require prompt
intervention. The evaluation of over-stressed personnel is difficult but not impossible when both the soldier
and the evaluator are in MOPP. The primary method of mental health evaluation is the interview and
mental status examination. For details on controlling stress reactions, see FM 8-51.</p>


<h3>Section VI. HEALTH SERVICE LOGISTICS</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-24" id="Para_5-24"></a>5-24. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">As in all combat situations, the protection of medical supplies and equipment on the integrated battlefield is
a must. Without medical supplies and equipment, HSS will be greatly diminished. Thus, the flow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-12" id="Page_5-12">[5-12]</a></span>
supplies must continue to forward units as they are requested, including during NBC operations. For
detailed information on providing health service logistics see FM 4-02.1 and FM 8-10-9.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-25" id="Para_5-25"></a>5-25. Protecting Supplies in Storage</h4>

<p class="noindent">Protecting supplies can be accomplished by placing them under tents, using plastic wraps, or providing
storage warehouses with CB filtered-conditioned (heated or cooled) air systems. Wrapping supplies in two
layers of plastic material provides protection from most agents for a short period of time; the thicker the plastic
material, the longer the protection. Effectiveness of protective procedures can be checked by placing M9 tape
on supplies and between layers of the covering. Protection from the thermal and blast effects of nuclear
detonations requires much more elaborate measures. Placing the supplies in trenches, inside earthen berms,
behind stonewalls, or in other field expedient facilities will enhance the protective posture of supplies from the
nuclear effects. Even when taking these protective measures, a quantity of supplies will become
contaminated and must be replaced. Plans should be in place for replacement of lost items.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-26" id="Para_5-26"></a>5-26. Protecting Supplies During Shipment</h4>

<p class="noindent">During shipment, supplies are protected by placement inside MILVANs, in covered enclosed vehicles, or
by wrapping them in several layers of plastic, in tarpaulins, or in other protective material. To monitor
exposure of supplies to chemical agents during shipment, place M9 detector paper between the wrappings.
If exposure is limited to the outer layer, simple removal of this layer may be all that is required to eliminate
the contamination. Decontamination is much easier when the supplies and equipment have been protected
by multilayers of over-wraps.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_5-27" id="Para_5-27"></a>5-27. Organizational Maintenance</h4>

<p class="noindent">Maintenance on vehicles, equipment, and medical equipment will become much more complex under NBC
conditions. Most chemical agents are soluble in organic solvents such as gasoline, motor oils, and lubricants.
The agent may be removed from the equipment by these solvents, but exposure to the contaminated solvents
will produce the same effects as exposure to the agent on the equipment. The agents may seep down around
the threads of bolts, in cracks and crevices of the equipment, and inside the cabinets or enclosures of
equipment. These potential contamination sources produce an increased hazard to maintenance personnel.
Decontamination of some items, especially medical equipment, may be a problem for maintenance personnel.
The use of standard decontamination agents will cause damage beyond repair to most medical equipment
and electronic equipment. In some instances, removal of chemical agents will require aging (off-gassing) of
the agent. Turning the equipment on and running it, or just exposing the equipment to warm air will speed
the off-gassing process. Maintenance personnel must perform all procedures in MOPP Level 4 until
decontamination is completed. Radiation will penetrate the metal structures of vehicles and other equipment;
radioactive material will be absorbed into the lubricants and fuels. Decontamination of this type of
contamination is very difficult, if not impossible. Personnel must use radiation detection equipment to
determine the extent of contamination and decontaminate the items as much as possible. Dusting or
washing with water can remove any fallout on the surface of vehicles and nonelectrical/electronic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-13" id="Page_5-13">[5-13]</a></span>
components of equipment. Removal of radioactivity absorbed into metals or mixed in lubricants and fuels is
beyond the capabilities of unit personnel. See FM 3-5 for decontamination procedures.</p>


<h3>Section VII. HOMELAND SECURITY RESPONSE</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_5-28" id="Para_5-28"></a>5-28. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive Response</h4>

<p class="noindent">Although, homeland security is not a specific military mission, commanders must plan for and be prepared
to support a lead federal agency (such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Federal Emergency
Management Agency) in response to CBRNE event. When the CBRNE event occurs on a military
installation, the Weapons of Mass Destruction&mdash;Incident Support Team (WMD-IST) is the lead federal
agency in charge of responding and establishes an incident command center (ICC). The installation medical
authority (IMA) provides the HSS initial response to the event site. Request for assistance from deployable
HSS organizations and staffs are initiated by the IMA through military channels. The incident commander
will submit a request for HSS assistance to a CBRNE event off the military installation through the
appropriate federal channels. The President will direct any DOD response in support of a lead federal
agency to a CBRNE event. The Presidential direction to assist will be passed down through military

en route care on locally provided transport vehicles.</li>

<li>Providing guidance to local responders in the management of CBRNE casualties. The
guidance may be on the correct use of antidotes, chemoprophylaxis, prevention of contamination spread in
the MTF, patient decontamination at the MTF, and other related medical management procedures.</li>

MEDICAL EFFECTS OF NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND TOXIC INDUSTRIAL MATERIAL</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_A-1" id="Para_A-1"></a>A-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">Biological and chemical weapons/agents may be employed by assassins, terrorists, rebels, and insurgents,
as well as well-formed battle organizations, across the continuum of operations. In addition, nuclear
weapons will remain a threat on the future battlefield. Another weapon that may be used is the RDD. The
RDD can cause significant damage and present health hazards to fighting forces by exposing them to
radiation without the thermal and full blast effects of nuclear weapons. The RDD can disperse radioactive
material over an area of the battlefield; the area covered is dependent upon the amount of radioactive and
explosive material used. In order to detonate a nuclear weapon, an adversary must first obtain access to the
appropriate weapons-grade material. However, an RDD can be produced and used by anyone with access
to industrial or medical radioisotopes and explosives. Biological agents are easy to disperse on the
battlefield without immediate detection; however, their effects on exposed troops can change the course of
the battle. Some nations consider chemical weapons as a component of their munitions for the battlefield.
As more nations enter the arena of developing biological and chemical weapons, their potential effects on
our troops will increase. The enemy's use of TIMs as weapons or collateral damage to TIM storage
faculties can severely affect the unit personnel's ability to continue the mission. The signs and symptoms of
some TIM exposure can be the same as those presented from exposure to NBC weapons. Considerations of
both the physical and biological effects of these weapons are required for HSS operations. Field Manual
4-02.283 provides additional information on nuclear and radiological effects; FM 8-284 provides additional
information on biological agent effects; FM 8-285 provides additional information on CW effects; FM 8-500
provides detailed information on hazardous material (TIM) effects.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-2" id="Para_A-2"></a>A-2. Physical Effects of Nuclear Weapons</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The principal physical effects of nuclear weapons are blast, thermal radiation (heat), and
nuclear radiation. These effects are dependent upon the yield (or size) of the weapon expressed in kilotons
(KT), the physical design of the weapon (such as conventional and enhanced), and the method of
employment. The distribution of energy (<a href="#FIG_A-1">Figure A-1</a>) from the detonation of a moderate-sized (3 to 10 KT)
weapon is as follows:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Fifty percent as blast.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Thirty-five percent as thermal radiation; made up of a wide spectrum of electromagnetic
radiation, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light and some soft x-ray radiation.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Fourteen percent as nuclear radiation, 4 percent as initial ionizing radiation composed of
neutrons and gamma rays emitted within the first minute after detonation, and 10 percent as residual nuclear
radiation (fallout).</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) One percent as EMP.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Larger weapons are more destructive than smaller weapons, but the destructive effect is not
linear. <a href="#TAB_A-1">Table A-1</a> presents a comparison of three aspects of nuclear weapons effects with yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-2" id="Page_A-2">[A-2]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="center"><i><a name="FIG_A-1" id="FIG_A-1"></a>Figure A-1. Distribution of energy.</i></p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The altitude at which the weapon is detonated determines the blast, thermal, and nuclear
radiation effects. Nuclear blasts are classified as air, surface, or subsurface bursts.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) An airburst is a detonation in air at an altitude below 30,000 meters, but high enough that
the fireball does not touch the land or water surface. The altitude is varied to obtain the desired tactical
effects. Initial radiation will be a significant hazard, but there is essentially no local fallout. However, the
ground immediately below the airburst may have a small area of neutron-induced radioactivity. This may
pose a hazard to troops passing through the area.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) A surface burst is a detonation in which the fireball actually touches and vaporizes the
land or water surface. In this case, the area affected by blast, thermal radiation, and initial nuclear radiation
will be smaller than for an airburst of comparable yield. However, in the region around ground zero, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-3" id="Page_A-3">[A-3]</a></span>
destruction will be much greater and a crater is often produced. Additionally, all the material that was
within the fireball becomes fallout and will be a hazard downwind. A surface burst is the most likely type of
terrorist detonation.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) A subsurface burst is an explosion in which the detonation is below the surface of land or
water. Cratering usually results. If the burst does not penetrate the surface, the only hazard is from the
ground or water shock. If the burst penetrates the surface, blast, thermal, and initial nuclear radiation will
be present, though less than for a surface burst of comparable yield. Local fallout will be heavy over a
small area.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) A high altitude burst occurs above 30,000 meters. Radiation and physical effects do not
reach the ground and there is no local fallout. This is the only detonation where the effects of the EMP are
significant. Nonhardened electronic equipment including many medical devices may become inoperative.
The EMP damage is a moot point with other types of detonations, as its range is primarily limited to the area
of intense physical destruction.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_A-3" id="Para_A-3"></a>A-3. Physiological Effects of Nuclear Weapons</h4>

<p class="noindent">The physiological effects of nuclear weapons are the result of exposure to the blast; thermal radiation;
ionizing radiation (initial or residual) effects; or a combination of these. For smaller weapons (less than 10
KT), ionizing radiation is the primary creator of casualties requiring medical care, while for larger weapons
(greater than 10 KT), thermal radiation is the primary creator of casualties.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The rapid compression and decompression of blast waves on the human body results in
transmission of pressure waves through the tissues. Resulting damage is primarily at junctions between
tissues of different densities (bone and muscle), or at the interface between tissue and airspace. Lung tissue
and the gastrointestinal system (both contain air) are particularly susceptible to injury. The tissue disruptions
can lead to severe hemorrhage or to an air embolism; either can be rapidly fatal. Direct overpressure
effects do not extend out as far from the point of detonation as the drag force and are often masked by the
drag force effects. A typical range of probability of lethality, with variations in overpressure for a 1 KT
weapon, is shown in <a href="#TAB_A-2">Table A-2</a>.</p>

</table></div>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(1) The significance of the data is that the human body is relatively resistant to static
overpressure compared to rigid structures such as buildings. For example, an unreinforced cinder block
panel will shatter at 0.1 to 0.2 atmospheres.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Overpressure lower than those in <a href="#TAB_A-2">Table A-2</a> can cause nonlethal injuries such as lung
damage and eardrum rupture. Lung damage is a relatively serious injury, usually requiring hospitalization,
even if not fatal; whereas eardrum rupture is a minor injury, often requiring no treatment at all.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) The threshold level of overpressure for an unreinforced unreflected blast wave that
can cause lung-damage is about 1.0 atmosphere.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) The threshold level for eardrum rupture is around 0.2 atmospheres; the overpressure
associated with a 50 percent probability of eardrum rupture is about 1.1 atmospheres.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Casualties requiring medical treatment from direct blast effects are produced by
overpressure between 1.0 and 3.5 atmospheres. However, other effects (such as indirect blast injuries and
thermal injuries) are so predominate that patients with only direct blast injuries make up a small part of the
patient workload.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-5" id="Page_A-5">[A-5]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The drag forces (indirect blast) of the blast winds are proportional to the velocities and
duration of the winds. The winds are relatively short in duration, but can reach velocities of several
hundred km per hour. Injury can result from missiles impacting on the body or from the physical
displacement of the body against objects and structures.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) The distance from the point of detonation at which severe indirect injury occurs is
greater than that for equally serious direct blast injuries. A high probability of serious indirect injury can
occur when the peak overpressure is about 0.2 atmospheres. This range will increase with the increased
size of the weapon; for a 1 KT weapon, the range is 0.22 km, whereas for a 20 KT weapon, the range is
0.76 km. At greater ranges injuries will occur and casualties will be generated, but not consistently.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) The drag forces of the blast winds produced by a nuclear detonation are so great that
almost any form of vegetation or structure will be broken up or fragmented into missiles. Thus, multiple,
varied missile injuries will be common, increasing their overall severity and significance. <a href="#TAB_A-3">Table A-3</a> lists
ranges at which significant missile injuries can be expected.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Heavy, blunt missiles may not penetrate, but can result in significant injury, particularly
fractures. The threshold velocity for skull fractures from a 4.5 milligram (mg) missile is about 4.6 meters
per second (m/sec).</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) The drag forces of the blast winds are strong enough to displace large objects (such as
vehicles), or cause large structures to collapse (such as buildings) resulting in serious crushing injuries.
Man himself can become a missile resulting in injuries (called translational injuries). The velocity at which
the body is displaced will determine the probability and the severity of injury. Assuming a displacement of
3.0 meters, the impact velocity associated with various degrees of injury is shown in <a href="#TAB_A-5">Table A-5</a>. The

<h4><a name="Para_A-4" id="Para_A-4"></a>A-4. Biological Effects of Thermal Radiation</h4>

<p class="noindent">The thermal radiation emitted by a nuclear detonation causes burns in two ways&mdash;by direct absorption of the
thermal energy through exposed surfaces (flash burns); or by the indirect action of fires in the environment
(flame burns). Indirect flame burns can easily outnumber all other types of injury.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Thermal radiation travels outward from the fireball in a straight line; therefore, the amount of
energy available to cause flash burns decreases rapidly with distance. Close to the fireball all objects will be
incinerated. The range for 100 percent lethality will vary with yield, height of burst, weather, environment,
and immediacy of treatment. The critical factors determining the degree of burn injury are the flux (calories
per square centimeter/second [cal/cm<sup><small>2</small></sup>/sec]) and the duration of the thermal pulse. The total amount of
thermal radiation needed to cause a flash partial thickness burn on exposed skin will vary with the yield of
the weapon and the nature of the pulse (<a href="#TAB_A-7">Table A-7</a>). Most burn patients will come from the zones where
partial thickness burns occur. In areas where radiation, blast, and thermal intensity are highest, burn
victims surviving long enough to reach medical care will be rare.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The battle dress uniform (BDU), MOPP gear, or any other clothing

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Indirect (flame) burns result from exposure to fires caused by the thermal effects in the
environment, particularly from ignition of clothing. The larger-yield weapons are more likely to cause
firestorms over extensive areas. There are too many variables in the environment to predict either incidence
or severity of casualties. Expect the burns to be far less uniform (in degree) and not limited to exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-8" id="Page_A-8">[A-8]</a></span>
surfaces. For example, the respiratory system may be exposed to the effects of hot gases produced by
extensive fires. Respiratory system burns cause high morbidity and high mortality rates.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The initial pulse of radiation in the optical and thermal bands can cause injuries in the forms of
flash blindness and retinal scarring. The initial brilliant flash of light produced by the nuclear detonation
causes flash blindness. This flash swamps the retina, bleaching out the visual pigments and producing
temporary blindness. During daylight hours, this temporary effect may last for about 2 minutes. At night,
with the pupil dilated for dark adaptation, flash blindness will affect personnel at greater ranges and for greater
durations. Partial recovery can be expected in 3 to 10 minutes, though it may require 15 to 35 minutes for full
night adaptation recovery. Retinal scarring is the permanent damage from a retinal burn. It will occur only
when the fireball is actually in the individual's field of view and should be a relatively uncommon injury. The
location of the scar will determine the degree of interference with vision. Because night vision apparatus
electronically amplifies an image, it cannot transmit the flash intensity and will not cause eye injury.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-5" id="Para_A-5"></a>A-5. Physiological Effects of Ionizing Radiation</h4>

<p class="noindent">A nuclear burst results in four types of ionizing radiation: neutrons, gamma rays, beta, and alpha radiation.
The initial burst is characterized by neutrons and gamma rays while the residual radiation is primarily
alpha, beta, and gamma rays. The effect of radiation on a living organism varies greatly by the type of
radiation to which the organism is exposed. See <a href="#TAB_A-8">Table A-8</a> for characteristics of nuclear radiation.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Alpha particles are extremely massive, charged particles (four times the mass of a neutron);
they are a fallout hazard. Because of their size, alpha particles cannot travel far and are fully stopped by the
dead layers of the skin or by the uniform. Alpha particles are a negligible external hazard, but if inhaled or
ingested, can cause significant internal damage.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Beta particles are very light, charged particles that are found primarily in fallout radiation.
These particles can travel a short distance in tissue; if large quantities are involved, they can produce
damage to the basal stratum of the skin. The lesion produced is similar to a thermal burn (called a beta burn).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Gamma rays, emitted during the nuclear detonation and in fallout, are uncharged radiation
similar to X rays. They are highly energetic and pass through matter easily. Because of its high
penetrability, radiation can be distributed throughout the body, resulting in whole body exposure.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Neutrons, like gamma rays, are uncharged, are only emitted during the nuclear detonation, and are
not a fallout hazard. However, neutrons have significant mass and interact with the nuclei of atoms, severely
disrupting atomic structures. Compared to gamma rays, they can cause 20 times more damage to tissue.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> When radiation interacts with atoms, energy is deposited resulting in ionization (electron
excitation). This ionization may involve certain critical molecules or structures in a cell, producing its
characteristic damage. Two modes of action in the cell are direct and indirect action. The radiation may
directly hit a particularly sensitive atom or molecule in the cell. The damage from this is irreparable; the
cell either dies or is caused to malfunction. The radiation can also damage a cell indirectly by interacting
with water molecules in the body. The energy deposited in the water leads to the creation of toxic
molecules; the damage is transferred to and affects sensitive molecules through this toxicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-10" id="Page_A-10">[A-10]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> The most radiosensitive organ systems in the body are the male reproductive, the
hematopoietic, and the gastrointestinal systems. The relative sensitivity of an organ to direct radiation
injury depends upon its component tissue sensitivities. Cellular effects of radiation, whether due to direct or
indirect damage, are basically the same for the different kinds and doses of radiation. The simplest effect is
cell death. With this effect, the cell is no longer present to reproduce and perform its primary function.
Changes in cellular function can occur at lower radiation doses than those that cause cell death. Changes
can include delays in phases of the mitotic cycle, disrupted cell growth, permeability changes, and changes
in motility. In general, actively dividing cells are most sensitive to radiation. Additionally, radiosensitivity
tends to vary inversely with the degree of differentiation of the cell.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> Predicting radiation effects is difficult because often it is unknown which organs were exposed.
Thus, most predictions are based on whole body irradiation. Partial body and specific organ irradiation will
occur due to shielding by equipment, from fallout particles, or from internal deposition. Depending upon
the organ system, the irradiation can be severe. The severe radiation sickness resulting from external,
whole body irradiation and its consequent organ effects is a primary medical concern. The median lethal
dose (LD) of radiation that will kill 50 percent of the exposed persons within a period of 60 days (designated
as LD50/60) is estimated to be approximately 4.5 gray (Gy) if appropriate medical care is not provided to
the casualties. Medical intervention should raise this figure to approximately 10 Gy. This larger figure
includes most of the casualties who would be actually capable of reaching medical care following a nuclear
detonation, and nearly all those who could be exposed to a RDD. For acute effects of single high dose rate
exposures of whole-body irradiation to healthy adults see <a href="#TAB_A-9">Table A-9.</a></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> Recovery of a particular cell system will occur if a sufficient fraction of a given stem cell
population remains after radiation injury and appropriate stimulation and protection are received. Complete
recovery may appear to occur; however, the immune system may repair incompletely with consequent
greater susceptibility to future insult from a variety of agents. It is possible for late somatic effects to have a
higher probability of occurring because of the radiation damage. Efficacy of both prior and future
immunization in this group is not adequately understood.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>i.</i> Interactions between radiological injury and chemical or biological agents appear to be
synergistic. Insult by these agents in radiologically injured personnel, even in individually subclinical
dosages, may result in significant clinical illness.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-6" id="Para_A-6"></a>A-6. Handling and Managing Radiologically Contaminated Patients</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Radiologically Contaminated Patients.</i> Personnel from contaminated areas may have fallout
on their skin and clothing. Although the individual will not be radioactive, he may suffer radiation injury
from the contamination. Removal of the contamination should be accomplished as soon as possible;
definitely before admission into a clean treatment area. The distinction must be made between a radiation-injured
soldier and one who is radiologically contaminated. Although personnel may have received
substantial radiation exposure, this exposure alone does not result in the individual being contaminated.
Contaminated personnel do not pose a short-term hazard to the medical staff, rather the contamination is a
hazard to the individuals' health. However, without patient decontamination, medical personnel may
receive sufficient exposure to create beta burns, especially with extended exposure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-11" id="Page_A-11">[A-11]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Handling Radiologically Contaminated Patients.</i> To properly handle radiologically
contaminated personnel, medical personnel must first detect the contamination. Detectors that may be used are
the AN/PDR27 and AN/VDR2 to monitor patients for contamination. Generally, a reading on the meter
twice the current background reading indicates that the patient is contaminated. Monitoring is conducted when
potentially contaminated personnel arrive at the MTF. This monitoring is conducted at the MTF's receiving
point before admitting the patient. Contaminated patients must be decontaminated before admission.
Removal of radiological contamination is less important than immediate lifesaving treatment and providing
the best possible medical care. Lifesaving care before decontamination is provided outside the MTF.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Decontamination.</i> Removing all outer clothing and a brief washing or brushing of exposed
skin will reduce 95 percent of contamination; vigorous bathing or showering is unnecessary. See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a>
for patient decontamination procedures.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Internal Contamination.</i> Internalization of radioactive isotopes will primarily occur via
inhalation, ingestion, and contaminated wounds. Extensive internal decontamination should only be
undertaken when individual dose estimates indicate that the individual will benefit from the procedures.
Soldiers who wear their protective mask will be adequately protected from inhalation and ingestion of
radioactive particulate matter. Internal contamination is considered a delayed problem and does not
influence triage categories, as does irradiation injury.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <i>Treatment.</i> Treatment procedures for radiation injuries are described in FM 4-02.283, FM 8-9,
and the NATO Handbook, <i>Emergency War Surgery</i>. Appropriate medical intervention and bone marrow
resuscitation will prevent most deaths secondary to irradiation and infection.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_A-8" id="Para_A-8"></a>A-8. Effects of Biological Weapons</h4>

<p class="noindent">Biological warfare is the intentional use, by an enemy, of live agents or toxins to cause death and disease
among personnel, animals, and plants, or to deteriorate materiel.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Live Agents.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Live agents are living organisms like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. They can be delivered
directly (artillery or aircraft spray), or through a vector such as a flea or tick. Advances in modern
weaponizing of biological agents have become easier.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) For some agents, only a few organisms are needed to cause infection. Live agents are
small and light; they can be spread great distances by the wind and contaminate unfiltered or nonairtight
places.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Aerosolized particles of 1 to 5 micron (μ) size carrying live agents are small and light.
They require time after they are ingested to multiply enough to overcome the body's defenses. This
incubation period may vary from hours to days or weeks depending on the type of organism. Thus, to be
effective, a live agent attack would need to be launched well in advance of a tactical assault.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) These agents are sensitive to environmental conditions (for example humidity and
sunlight). Many bacterial agents will not survive outside the host organism (human and animals).</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Live agents are not detectable by any of the five physical senses; usually the first
indication of a biological attack is the ill personnel. The diseases caused by live agents may be difficult to
control when the aerosol attack is directed against a large population. Some diseases may be transmitted
from person-to-person after the initial attack; examples include plague, smallpox, and some viral
hemorrhagic fevers.</p>

<p class="para-1">(6) Because of their incubation period and life cycle, likely areas for live agent use are in the
combat service support (CSS) area; but attacks in forward areas cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Spore Forming Biological Agents.</i> Spore formers such as anthrax can survive for an extended
time, even under very adverse environmental conditions (dry, extremes of temperatures, and flooding).
Once inhaled, ingested, or injected into the human body, the spores germinate and produce the illness.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Toxins.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Toxins are by-products (poisons) produced by plants, animals, or microorganisms. It is
the poisons that harm man, not the organisms that make the toxins. In the past, the only way to deliver
toxins on a large scale was by using the organism. With today's technology large quantities of many toxins
can be produced; thus, they can be delivered without the accompanying organism.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Toxins have several desirable traits. They are poisonous compounds that do not grow,
reproduce, or die after they have been dispersed; they are more easily controlled than live organisms. Field
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-15" id="Page_A-15">[A-15]</a></span>
monitors capable of providing prompt warning of a toxin attack are not available; therefore, personnel must
learn to quickly recognize signs of attack, such as observing unexplained symptoms of victims. Toxins
produce effects similar to those caused by chemical agents; however, the victims will not respond to the
first-aid measures that work against chemical agents. Unlike live agents, mycotoxins (T2) can penetrate
intact skin; other toxins cannot. Because the effects on the body are direct, the symptoms of an attack may
appear very rapidly. The potency of most toxins is such that very small doses will cause injuries and/or
death. Thus, their use by an enemy may be an alternative to chemical agents because it allows the use of
fewer resources to cover the same or a larger area. Slight exposure at the edges of an attack area may
produce severe symptoms or death from exposure to toxins because of their extreme toxicity. Lethal or
injury downwind hazard zones for toxins may be far greater than those of CW agents.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-9" id="Para_A-9"></a>A-9. Behavior of Biological Weapons</h4>

<p class="noindent">Biological agents can be disseminated in a spectrum of physical states. They may be living microorganisms
or spore forms of the organism. See <a href="#TAB_A-11">Table A-11</a> for stability of various biological agents. They may be
spread by&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>Arthropods.</li>

<li>Contact with infected animals.</li>

<li>Contamination of food and water.</li>

<li>Aerosol, liquid, or solid dispersion.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The only requirement is that they must be stable enough to survive transport and dissemination. The
toxicity of biological agents is not the same for everyone; each individual does not react exactly the same
way to the same amount of an agent. Some are more resistive than others because of race, sex, age, or
other factors. The dose is the quantity of a biological agent received by the subject. The penetration of

<h4><a name="Para_A-10" id="Para_A-10"></a>A-10. Management of Biological Warfare Patients</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Management.</i> Management of patients suffering from the effects of BW agents may include
the need for isolation. Barrier nursing for patients suspected of suffering from exposure to BW agents will
reduce the possibility of spreading the disease to health care providers and other patients. Specimens must
be collected and submitted to the designated supporting laboratory for identification. For details on hospital
infection control aspects of managing BW casualties, see FM 8-284.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Mass Casualty.</i> A BW agent attack can produce a mass casualty situation at all levels of HSS.
A major problem with a BW mass casualty situation is that HSS personnel are more susceptible to becoming
a casualty to BW agents. Also, the ill patient may be the first indicator that a BW agent has been dispersed.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Decontamination.</i> Decontamination is an individual and unit responsibility. However, some
individuals may arrive at the MTF that have not been decontaminated or that become contaminated en route
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-17" id="Page_A-17">[A-17]</a></span>
to the MTF. These individuals must be decontaminated at the MTF before they are admitted to prevent
contamination of the MTF and exposure of medical personnel to the biological agent. See <a href="#APP_G">Appendix G</a> for
details on patient decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Treatment.</i> Specific treatment is dependent upon the BW agent used. Patients are treated for
symptomatic presentation unless the BW agent identity is known. Field Manuals 8-9 and 8-284 provide
detailed information on medical management and treatment.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-11" id="Para_A-11"></a>A-11. Effects of Chemical Weapons</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> A chemical agent is a chemical that is used to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate man
because of its physiological effects. They can be disseminated by artillery, aircraft, rocket, or by
nonconventional means used by terrorists. When first employed in combat during World War I, the chemical
weapon (chlorine) was so effective that the attacking Germans were not prepared to exploit the success.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Chemical agents are very effective weapons against poorly trained and equipped forces;
however, they are less effective against well-trained forces.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_A-12" id="Para_A-12"></a>A-12. Behavior of Chemical Weapons</h4>

<p class="noindent">Chemical agents can be disseminated as a gas, vapor, or aerosol under ambient conditions. They have a range
of odors varying from none to highly pungent characteristics. Their stability is dependent upon the environmental
conditions in the area of employment. See <a href="#TAB_A-11">Table A-11</a> for persistency of various chemical agents.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The toxicity of a chemical agent is not the same for everyone; each individual does not react
exactly the same way to the same amount of an agent. Some are more resistant than others because of
physiological factors. The dose is the quantity of a chemical received by the individual for percutaneous or
oral doses and as a time-weighted concentration, milligrams-minute (m3), for inhalation. It is usually
expressed as milligrams of agent per kilogram of subject body weight (mg/kg). The LD50 is the dose that
kills 50 percent of the exposed population. The incapacitation dose 50 (ID50) is the incapacitation dose for
50 percent of the exposed subjects. The penetration of agents by various routes need not be accompanied by
irritation or delayed superficial damage to the absorbent surface, but there are often unique signs and
symptoms identifiable by the route of entry.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Gaseous, vapor, and aerosol chemical agents often enter the body through the respiratory
tract (inhalation injury). The agent may be absorbed by any part of the respiratory tract from the mucosa of
the nose and mouth to the alveoli of the lungs. Aerosol particles larger than 5 μ tend to be retained in the
upper respiratory tract; particles in the 1 to 5 μ range are retained in the deep volume of the lungs; while those
below 1 μ tend to be breathed in and out again; although a few are retained in the deep volume of the lungs.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Vapors and droplets of liquids can be absorbed from the surface of the skin and mucous
membranes. Toxic compounds that are harmful to the skin can produce their effects in liquid or solid state.
Agents penetrating the skin may form temporary reservoirs under the skin; the vapors of some volatile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-18" id="Page_A-18">[A-18]</a></span>
liquids can penetrate the skin and cause intoxication. Additionally, wounds and abrasions may present areas
that are more permeable than intact skin.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Chemical agents may be divided into two main categories (persistent and nonpersistent) that
describe how long they are capable of producing casualties. <a href="#TAB_A-12">Table A-12</a> lists the common chemical
agents, their effects and time of effectiveness. <a href="#TAB_A-13">Table A-13</a> lists the types and characteristics of common
chemical agents.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Persistent agents continue to present a hazard for considerable periods (days) after
delivery by remaining as a contact hazard, or by slowly vaporizing to produce a hazard by inhalation.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Nonpersistent agents disperse rapidly after release and present an immediate, short
duration (hours) hazard. They are released as airborne particles, aerosols, and gases.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_A-13" id="Para_A-13"></a>A-13. Characteristics of Chemical Agents</h4>

<p class="noindent">The effectiveness of a chemical agent is a measure of how much agent is required to produce the desired
effect. Thus, an agent that is toxic at a lower dose than another similar agent is more effective. Besides
dose required for a given effect, persistency may be used to measure effectiveness. Persistency depends on
the agent's physical characteristics, the amount of agent delivered, its physical state, weapons system used,
the terrain, and weather in the target area. The desired effects will determine the physical, chemical, and
toxicological properties of the chemical agent employed.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Nerve agents are primarily organophosphorus esters similar to insecticides. Those of military
importance are combined under this term. Although some have been given names, they are usually known
by their code letters: GA; GB; GD; and VX. They are all liquids, varying in volatility that is in a range
between gasoline and heavy lubricating oil. Their freezing points are -40 degrees Celsius or lower.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Liquid nerve agents are pale yellow to colorless and are almost odorless. They are
moderately soluble in water and highly soluble in lipids (oil). They are rapidly destroyed by strong alkalies
and chlorinating compounds. Normal clothing is readily penetrated by liquid or vapor agents. Butyl rubber
and synthetic material are more resistant than natural fibers. Agents can penetrate into nonabsorbent
material such as web belts and can continue to present a hazard by desorption (off-gassing) of the vapor.
Although local sweating and twitching may occur, usually there is no local irritant change after cutaneous
exposure. Toxicity depends upon the route of entry and physical characteristics.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Nerve agents strongly inhibit the cholinesterase enzymes. When acetylcholine is released
by the nerve junction, it is hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Acetylcholine is the chemical mediator for
transmission of the nerve impulses in numerous synapses of the central nervous system (CNS) and the
autonomic nervous system and at the endings of the cholinergic nerves (for example: affecting the smooth
muscles of the iris, ciliary, bronchial tree, and gastrointestinal tract). The inhibition of cholinesterase by
nerve agents is almost irreversible, so the effects are prolonged. Until the cholinesterase level is restored to
normal, there is an increased susceptibility to nerve agent exposure. During this time, the effects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-20" id="Page_A-20">[A-20]</a></span>
repeated exposure are cumulative and the patient may feel "subpar" (for example: tired, fatigue easily, poor
appetite, impaired concentration) until recovery is complete.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Nerve agent poisoning is easily identified by the characteristic signs and symptoms
as follows:</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) <b>MILD</b> symptoms (self-aid). Casualties with MILD symptoms may experience most
or all of the following:</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Unexplained runny nose.</li>

<li>Unexplained sudden headache.</li>

<li>Sudden drooling.</li>

<li>Difficulty in seeing (dimness of vision) (miosis).</li>

<li>Tightness in the chest or difficulty in breathing.</li>

<li>Localized sweating and muscular twitching in the contaminated area.</li>

<li>Stomach cramps.</li>

<li>Nausea.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Casualties with <b>MODERATE</b> symptoms (buddy aid) will experience an increase in
the severity of most or all of the MILD symptoms. Especially prominent will be an increase in fatigue,
weakness, and muscle fasciculations. The progress of symptoms from MILD to MODERATE indicates
either inadequate atropine treatment or continuing exposure to agent.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) <b>SEVERE</b> symptoms (buddy aid). Casualties with SEVERE symptoms may
experience most or all of the MILD symptoms, plus most or all of the following:</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Strange or confused behavior.</li>

<li>Wheezing, dyspnea (severe difficulty in breathing), and coughing.</li>

<li>Severely pinpointed pupils.</li>

<li>Red eyes with tearing.</li>

<li>Vomiting.</li>

<li>Severe muscular twitching and general weakness.</li>

<li>Involuntary urination and defecation.</li>

<li>Convulsions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-21" id="Page_A-21">[A-21]</a></span></li>

<li>Unconsciousness.</li>

<li>Respiratory failure.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> There are three major families of blister agents (vesicants); HD and HN, L, and CX. Most
vesicants (except CX) are relatively persistent. Mustards can modify the structure of nucleic acids, cellular
membranes, and proteins by combining with certain functional groups (particularly the sulfhydryl-containing
enzymes) for which they have an affinity.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) The cutaneous syndrome is divided into four phases: latent, erythema, vesication, and
necrosis. Vesicants can penetrate the skin by contact with either liquid or vapor. The latent period is
characteristic of the agent. For mustards it is usually several hours, for L it is short, and for CX it is
negligible. The latent period is also affected by the dose, temperature, and humidity. The symptoms of the
erythema phase are red, painful itching followed by painful necrosis that heals slowly.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) In the eyes, vesicants produce intense pain and photophobia. Blistering of the eyelids
and mucous membranes can result in temporary blindness. Even after recovery, scars on the cornea can
reduce visual acuity.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) In the respiratory tract, these agents attack the mucous membranes irritating them. They
can paralyze vocal chords and can lead to chemical pneumonitis, or possibly death.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Although blister agents can affect other organs and produce deleterious effects, the skin,
eyes, and respiratory tract are the principle organs effected.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Chemical agents that attack lung tissue (choking agents) and cause pulmonary edema are
classed as lung damaging agents. Choking agents consist of CG and DP, CL, and PS. Phosgene is typical
of the lung-damaging agents; it is used as the example here.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Phosgene is a colorless gas that has an odor resembling new mown hay. Although
effects are primarily confined to the lungs, phosgene may also cause mild irritation of the eyes and upper
respiratory tract. Phosgene causes a shift in the membrane potential of the alveoli allowing the passage of
fluid into the alveoli, resulting in massive pulmonary edema and severely impairing the exchange of oxygen
(O<sub><small>2</small></sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>) between the capillary blood and the alveolar air.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Initially hypoxemia occurs and is followed shortly by hyperventilation when the frothy
edema fluid fills the bronchioli and CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> expiration stops.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Signs and symptoms during and immediately following exposure are coughing, tightness
of chest, nausea, occasionally vomiting, headache, and lacrimation (tearing).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Blood agents consist of AC and CK; both are readily absorbed by the mucous membranes and
the intact skin. The odor of AC resembles bitter almonds, but many people cannot detect it. Detecting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A-22" id="Page_A-22">[A-22]</a></span>
odor of CK is difficult because of its irritating and lacrimatory effects. It is also poorly absorbed by the
metallic salt-impregnated charcoal filters in the protective mask. These agents inhibit certain enzymes
(particularly cytochrome oxidase) that are important for oxidation-reduction in the cells; therefore, cell
respiration is inhibited and oxygen carried by the hemoglobin is not consumed causing the venous blood to
remain bright red. Initial symptoms are characterized by violent convulsions, increased deep respiratory
movements, followed by cessation of respiration within one minute, slowing of heart rate to death. High
concentrations exert their effects rapidly; however, if the patient is still alive after the cloud has passed, he
will probably recover spontaneously.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Incapacitating agents are chemicals that produce a temporary disabling condition that persists for
hours to days after exposure to the agent has ceased (unlike that produced by riot control agents). While not
required, medical treatment produces a more rapid recovery. Characteristics of these agents are that they&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Are highly potent and logistically feasible.</li>

<li>Produce their effects mainly by altering or disrupting the higher regulatory activity of
the CNS.</li>

<li>Produce effects that last for hours or days rather than momentary or fleeting.</li>

<li>Do not seriously endanger life, except in exceedingly high doses.</li>

<li>Produce no permanent injury.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The two types likely to be encountered are CNS depressants and CNS stimulants.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Central nervous system depressants are compounds that have a predominant effect of
depressing or blocking the activity of the CNS; often by interfering with the transmission of information
across synapses. An example of this type of agent is BZ. The action of acetylcholine, both peripherally and
centrally, appears to be blocked by BZ. Low doses disrupt higher integrative functions of memory,
problem solving, attention, and comprehension. High doses produce toxic delirium that destroys the ability
to perform any military task. Within the CNS, BZ seems to produce its effects in the same way as atropine.
Small doses cause sleepiness and decreased alertness with elevated heart rate, dry skin and eyelids,
drowsiness, increased pupil size, and elevated skin temperatures. Progressive intoxication is marked by an
inability to respond effectively to the environment (4 to 12 hours), followed by increasing activity and
random/unpredictable behavior (12 to 96 hours). Because the patient cannot sweat, heat stress becomes a
problem.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Central nervous system stimulants are agents that cause excessive nervous activity, often
by boosting or facilitating transmission of impulses across synapses. The effect is to "flood" the cortex and
other higher regulatory centers with too much information, making concentration difficult and causing
indecisiveness and an inability to act. These include LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. Intoxication shows
sympathetic stimulation (rapid heart rate, sweaty palms, pupillar enlargement, and cold extremities) and
mental excitation (nervousness, trembling, anxiety, and inability to relax or sleep); feelings of tension,
exhilaration, heightened awareness, paranoid ideas, and profound states of terror may also occur.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_A-14" id="Para_A-14"></a>A-14. Management of Chemical Agent Patients</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Management.</i> Movement of chemical agent casualties can spread the contamination to clean
areas. All casualties are decontaminated as far forward as the situation permits. All patients must be
decontaminated before they are admitted into a clean MTF. The admission of one contaminated patient into
an MTF will contaminate the facility; thereby reducing its treatment capabilities.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Mass Casualty.</i> A mass casualty situation is presented when chemical agents are employed.
Additional HSS personnel and equipment must be provided in a short period of time if the level of care is to
be maintained. Treatment at far forward MTFs is limited to life- or limb-saving care. Patients that can
survive evacuation to the next level of care are not treated at the forward facility. This provides time for
treating those patients that cannot survive the evacuation time.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Decontamination.</i> Decontamination is an individual and unit responsibility. However, some
individuals may arrive at the MTF that have not been decontaminated or that become contaminated en route
to the MTF. These individuals must be decontaminated at the MTF before they are admitted to prevent

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Management.</i> Movement of TIM casualties can spread the contamination to clean areas. All
casualties are decontaminated as close to the incident site as possible. All patients must be decontaminated
before they are admitted into a clean MTF. The admission of one contaminated patient into an MTF may

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Mass Casualty.</i> A mass casualty situation is presented when the number of casualties exceeds
the capabilities of medical personnel at the location to provide needed care at the incident site. Treatment at
the incident site is limited to life- or limb-saving care. Patients that can survive are evacuated to the nearest

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Decontamination.</i> Decontamination is an individual and first responder responsibility.
However, some individuals that self evacuated or were evacuated due to the mass casualty situation arrive at
the MTF that have not been decontaminated. These individuals must be decontaminated at the MTF before
they are admitted to prevent contamination of the MTF and exposure of unprotected medical personnel and
other patients to the TIM. See FM 8-500 for detailed information on decontamination procedures for TIM

SAMPLE/SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT</h2>


<h3>Section I. INTRODUCTION</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_B-1" id="Para_B-1"></a>B-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Critical elements for accuracy in analysis of NBC samples and physiological specimens are
correct collecting, packaging, handling, and transporting techniques. The quality of any analytical evaluation
is directly related to the quality of the sample/specimen and the degree of postcollection degradation that
occurs prior to testing. Health service support personnel collect and submit specimens for suspect NBC
hazards/agents involving humans and animals. Chemical corps and other nonmedical units collect and
submit environmental (air, plant, and soil) samples for suspect NBC hazards/agents. Preventive medicine
personnel collect and submit water and ice samples for suspect NBC hazards/agents. Veterinary personnel
collect and submit food samples, such as fruits and vegetables, and specimens from animals for suspect
NBC hazards/agents. Specimens collected from patients that are suspect of being exposed to a biological
agent are forwarded to the supporting medical laboratory (such as the TAML, AML or US Navy Forward
Deployed PVNTMED Unit) for analysis.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Essentially all military operations from war to stability operations and support operations may
generate medical laboratory testing requirements. Each scenario, geographical region, population base,
and suspect agent will impact on the type and amount of samples/specimens required and the collection
process. During all operations, express permission is required before collecting specimens from civilians
because of religious or sociological beliefs in many cultures. To obtain such specimens without permission
could result in unnecessary mission complications.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTES</p>

<p class="noindent">1. The term "sample" refers to nonhuman and nonanimal origin.
The term "specimen" refers to human and animal origin.<br />

2. Always consider that chemical agents may have been employed.
Check for chemical agents before collecting a biological sample/specimen.
Chemical agents can damage or destroy biological agents.
Also, chemical agents not identified in the sample/specimen can pose
a hazard to receiving laboratory personnel. Mark all samples that are
potentially contaminated with chemical agents as such.<br />

3. Precautions should be taken to protect the sample/specimen
collector from potential BW agents; at a minimum, respiratory
protection and rubber gloves must be worn. Additional care must
be taken when collecting samples/specimens to prevent cross-contamination.
Gloves must be changed or decontaminated between
sample/specimen collections.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-2" id="Page_B-2">[B-2]</a></span>

4. Samples will not be delivered to the clinical laboratory of an
MTF for analysis. They must be delivered to the designated supporting
medical laboratory for processing. This will prevent accidentally
spreading a biological agent in the MTF.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Coordination for follow-on testing is absolutely critical to the sample/specimen collection
process.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Coordination with the receiving laboratory should be made to establish sample requirements,
preferred collection techniques, methods of preservation, and transportation conditions, when the tactical
situation and/or mission permits.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> The number of medical specimens that need to be collected varies with the type of analysis
performed and the impact of the values determined. The number and types of "control" samples/specimens
required to validate test information is determined by the supporting medical laboratory personnel. Random
sampling, matched with control populations, or other techniques will be employed as the requirements are
identified.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-2" id="Para_B-2"></a>B-2. Sample/Specimen Background Information</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> A complete history of the circumstances about each sample's/specimen's acquisition must be
provided to the agency conducting the analysis.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Critical information includes, but is not limited to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Meteorological conditions. Describe what the meteorological conditions were at the time
of the alleged attack and at the time of the sampling.</li>

<li>Attack to collection time. State the length of time after alleged attack when sample/specimen
was taken.</li>

<li>Circumstances of acquisition. Describe how the sample/specimen was obtained and the
source of the sample/specimen.</li>

<li>Physical description. Describe the physical state of the sample/specimen (solid, liquid,
powder, apparent viscosity), color, approximate size, identity of the sample/specimen (that is, dirt, leaves,
blood, tissue), and dose rate (if radiologically contaminated).</li>

<li>Circumstances of the agent deposition. Describe the type of delivery system, a description
of how the weapon functioned, how the agent acted on release, sounds heard during dissemination, a
description of any craters or shrapnel found associated with the burst, and colors of smoke, flames, or mists
that may be associated with the attack.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-3" id="Page_B-3">[B-3]</a></span>
Agent effects on vegetation. Describe the general area (jungle, mountain, grassland) and
changes in the vegetation after the agent deposition (that is, color change, wilting, drying, dead) in the main
attack and fringe areas.</li>

<li>Agent effects on humans. How the agent affected personnel in the main attack area
versus fringe areas; the duration of agent effects; peculiar odors that may have been noticed in the area
before, during, or after an attack; measures taken that alleviated or worsened the effects; and the approximate
number of victims and survivors (include age and gender).</li>

<li>Agent effects on animals. Describe how they are affected.</li>

<li>Grid coordinates or other descriptive information on sample collection location.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_B-3" id="Para_B-3"></a>B-3. Sample/Specimen Collection and Preservation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Ante mortem Specimens.</i> Physiological specimens from living human or animal patients can
include just about any conceivable body source or excreted by-product. It must be noted that specimen
types are seldom interchangeable; the exact type and amount of specimen required for a specific assay must
be known before a collection procedure is initiated (see <a href="#TAB_B-1">Table B-1</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>Patients seen in an MTF may be the first and in some cases the only source for sampling
for suspect biological agent release. The primary medical care provider will determine the level of
treatment for these patients and the specimens required for laboratory diagnosis. The MTF laboratory is not
equipped to handle biological agents and, therefore, specimens generated will be forwarded to the supporting
medical laboratory for analysis. Patient disposition will be based on evacuation policies, exposure, suspect
agent, clinical symptoms, and required treatment/isolation.</li>

<li>Blood specimens represent the most common analytical sample. Certain techniques and
special care must be exercised to ensure an acceptable specimen is collected and to minimize an adverse
affect to the patient or specimen collector. In general, phlebotomy requires the use of a 20 to 22-gauge
needle to minimize mechanical hemolysis during aspiration using a syringe or Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup> tube collection
system. Blood collected with a syringe and needle should be transferred to an appropriate Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup>
tube immediately after collection. The type of tube, type of anticoagulant or preservative, and amount of
blood collected will vary with the specific assay requested. Unless some special sample preparation step is
required, the blood is best left in the original rubber-stopper tube for transport.</li>

<li>Urine specimens are best collected using a clean-catch (midstream, if possible) technique
in a sterile urine cup. The volume of sample required will vary depending on the specific assay requested;
however, 25 to 50 ml is sufficient for most tests.</li>

<li>Tissue specimens can originate from any body source accessible by scraping, swabbing,
or minor excision. Tissue specimens are collected only by medical trained personnel. Specific techniques
for collecting these specimens are not provided in this appendix.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-4" id="Page_B-4">[B-4]</a></span>
Sputum specimens are best collected using a sterile cup. The volume of specimen will
normally be very small. However, a sufficient quantity must be collected to provide for in-theater testing
and to provide for CONUS laboratory testing.</li>

<li>Nasal swabs should be collected using sterile cotton-tipped swabs. The swabs with
specimen from each person should be placed in a separate sterile container to prevent cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">In cases where the supporting laboratory cannot be contacted, as a
minimum the following specimens should be collected: Urine&mdash;25 to
50 ml in a sterile container. Blood&mdash;two 7 to 10 ml tubes without
anticoagulant (red-stopper Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup>); two 7 to 10 ml tubes with
potassium or sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) (lavender-stopper
VacutainerTM).</p>
<br />
</div>

<ul>
<li>All specimens (regardless of physiological source) must be labeled to positively identify
the individual or animal from whom it was collected; at a minimum, the individual's full name, unique
personal identification number (social security number, when possible), military unit and location, and date
and time of collection should be written on the label of the specimen container.</li>

<li>All specimens are collected using aseptic techniques. All specimens are packaged,
handled, and transported in a manner that ensures they arrive at the final destination laboratory in a testable
condition. Personal protection guidelines must be adhered to when collecting or processing specimens; at a
minimum, this includes gloves and a mask. In the laboratory, a gown or other protective items may also
need to be used. In the field, under suspect NBC conditions, collectors should be in MOPP Level 4 or
inside NBC-protected vehicles. Common sense and the clinical and/or tactical situation will determine the
extent of personal protection necessary.</li>

<li>Preservation of specimens, either chemically or mechanically (cooling), will be necessary
to minimize the amount of analyte degradation that occurs after removing the specimen from its physiological
microenvironment. The optimal preservation technique will vary with different laboratory tests and must be
confirmed for each requested assay. While freezing may preserve some serum constituents, freeze-thawing
cycles may denature others. Freezing may also completely destroy certain microorganisms. This caution
also applies to tissue specimens since "fixing" tissue with a standard 10 percent formalin solution will
preserve tissue for special staining techniques; however, it renders the specimens completely useless for
microbiological culture. Always verify specimen preservation requirements for storage and transport with
the supporting medical laboratory before processing the specimen. Ideally, confirmation of the correct
handling conditions should be coordinated before collection.</li>

<li>The importance of coordinating sample/specimen collection with the supporting laboratory
facility cannot be overstated. Contact the receiving laboratory for instructions when doubt exists
about the appropriate source, collection technique, storage and preservation conditions (such as, aerobic or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-5" id="Page_B-5">[B-5]</a></span>
anaerobic environment), and transportation requirements for samples/specimens. Extremely small volumes
of samples/specimens, properly collected and handled, can yield a tremendous amount of information to
assist in making medical, tactical, and strategic decisions. Conversely, very large quantities of poorly
collected and insufficiently preserved samples/specimens are essentially worthless for most analytical
techniques.</li>

<li>Analysis beyond intratheater capabilities will be coordinated by the supporting laboratory,
when deployed, or through medical channels in the absence of an in-theater supporting laboratory.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Post mortem and Forensic Specimens.</i> The analysis of specimens from deceased humans and
animals can provide valuable information about the disease, organisms, injuries, or environmental conditions
at the time of death. This information can greatly enhance the treatment of others affected by the same, or
physiologically similar, process. Specimen collection for post mortem or forensic examination is very
important; the techniques involved reflect a significant degree of training, experience, and skill. Most
specimens will be of the same type and size as for ante mortem specimens, but types and amounts of
specimens will be determined by the collector.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) The collection of specimens from remains should be conducted exclusively by a
pathologist, or other personnel specifically trained in forensic collection techniques. An exception is when
Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel are operating under radio silence conditions; the most qualified
medical person with the operation collects, preserves, and transports or coordinates transport of specimens
for evaluation. The same chain of custody requirements applies to specimens collected by SOF personnel,
as with all other specimens.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) A large amount of support information can be gained by analyzing the site of injury and
subsequent death. This "site scene" investigation requires a tremendous attention to detail and a trained
observer. If forensic personnel cannot be contacted, or will be unduly delayed in arriving at the scene, then
photographs of the victim and the immediate surroundings should be made. The scope and extent of the
photographs should be composed to reflect as much detail as possible to assist forensic personnel in
reviewing the scene retrospectively. In the event that photography is not feasible, detailed sketches of the
scene should be made to assist the forensic investigation.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Techniques such as cardiac or bladder puncture, needle biopsy of organs, spinal tap, or
exploratory laparotomy will not be performed by untrained personnel unless specifically requested and
directed by forensic investigators.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Water Sample Collection.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Water samples for identification or verification of biological agent contamination are
collected by PVNTMED personnel. The supporting laboratory should provide guidance on sampling
procedures and collecting kits for use in collecting the samples. In the absence of guidance, a technique for
use of the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> is described in FM 3-19.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) When sampling kits are not available, samples may be collected in other available sterile
containers. The best containers for use are the 100-ml glass bottles used for collecting routine water
samples. All water samples must be collected and placed in a cooler or refrigerator until the sample is
transported to its destination. During transportation the samples must be maintained at a temperature
between 1°C and 4°C.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Food Samples.</i> Veterinary personnel must collect suspect biologically contaminated food
samples for submission to the supporting laboratory for in-theater verification of contamination. All food
samples must be collected and placed in sterile containers. Place the samples in a cooler or refrigerator
until the sample is transported to its destination. During transportation the samples must be maintained at a
temperature between 1°C and 4°C.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <i>Animal Specimens.</i> Veterinary personnel collect specimens from suspect biologically contaminated/diseased
animals. The same types and amounts of specimens are prepared and shipped in the
same manner as are human specimens.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> <i>Environmental Samples.</i> Environmental samples are collected as directed in the operators'
manual or other publications for operating collection systems. Example: The Biological Integrated Detection
System (BIDS) collects an environmental sample using a single liquid sample collector. The collector is a
high-volume aerosol sampling and collection device. On demand it samples ambient air through a two-stage
virtual impactor that concentrates aerosol particles in the 2 to 10 micrometer diameter-size range. The
concentrate particle stream is directed through a wet collector containing a buffer solution and, over a 45-minute
period, a 40 to 50 ml sample is collected. On order or when test results indicate a suspected agent,
the sample and associated documentation are packaged and transported IAW FM 3-101-4.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> A strict chain of custody must be maintained for every sample/specimen collected. Use DD
Form 1911 (Material Courier Receipt), or other document (such as DA Form 4137 [Evidence/Property
Custody Document]) as directed for each sample/specimen collected. The chain of custody document must
accompany the sample/specimen during transport from the point of collection to the final receiving
laboratory. Each time the sample/specimen is transferred to another individual, the receiving person must
sign the document to show that they received the sample/specimen and state what happened to the sample/specimen
while in their custody. The document will provide the answer to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When was the sample/specimen collected?</li>

<li>Who has maintained custody of the sample/specimen?</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-9" id="Page_B-9">[B-9]</a></span>
What has been done with the sample/specimen at each change of custody?</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The samples/specimens must be appropriately packaged, labeled, and evacuated to the
designated medical laboratory for confirmation of a biological attack. The standard chain of custody for the
evacuation would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sampling unit.</li>

<li>Unit S2/security office or medical operations officer.</li>

<li>Technical escort unit or other command-designated escort personnel.</li>

<li>In-theater supporting medical laboratory.</li>

<li>Designated CONUS laboratory.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Section II. SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_B-5" id="Para_B-5"></a>B-5. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">The collection of environmental, and background (control) samples/medical specimens is an integral part of
investigating allegations pertaining to the first use of chemical or biological agents. The types of samples/specimens
taken and the collection methods primarily depend upon the circumstances encountered by the
collector. During all chemical and biological sampling operations, the commander establishes the required
protective equipment to fit the situation. This appendix includes a recommended list of equipment for use
during chemical and biological sampling operations (Table B-2).</p>

<h4><a name="Para_B-6" id="Para_B-6"></a>B-6. Expended Material</h4>

<p class="noindent">The NBC recon units collect samples under various circumstances. For example, a recon unit may collect
samples in an area free of hostile forces. The Special Forces NBC Reconnaissance team may collect
samples within the enemy area of operations or deep into the enemy's rear area. Samples include toxic
agent munitions, chemical products, air, water, soil, and vegetation. In addition, all expended material
used to collect the samples should be turned in to the laboratory with the samples. This material includes
items such as expended M256A1 kits, M8 and M9 paper. These items should be recovered, packaged, and
shipped with the suspected samples for analysis. Different information may be derived from each type of
sample; <a href="#TAB_B-3">Table B-3</a> compares different types of samples.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-7" id="Para_B-7"></a>B-7. Environmental Samples</h4>

<p class="noindent">Control or background samples that are collected from clean samples must be identical to the samples
collected from the areas near the attack areas as baseline data. The contaminated samples must be
compared to the baseline data (control samples). This is especially true if unknown or nonstandard
chemical and/or suspected biological agents were employed. The analysis center uses the control samples
to compare with a contaminated one. The recon unit collects control samples of soil, water, and vegetation
from areas about 500 meters upwind of an alleged attack area. Control samples generically are the same as
those collected in an alleged attack area. For example, if leaves from an apple tree in an attack area were
collected as a suspected contaminated sample, the recon team should collect leaves (as a control sample)
from an apple tree outside of the contaminated area. If water from a pond in the attack area is collected, the
recon unit should collect control samples of water from a pond (not a moving stream) in a nearby clean
area. The size of an environmental control sample should be about the same as the suspected contaminated
sample collected from the attack area (see <a href="#TAB_B-4">Table B-4</a>, page B-20).</p>

<p class="p2" />
<h4><a name="Para_B-8" id="Para_B-8"></a>B-8. Collection of Air and Vapor Samples</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Air is a good sample matrix since it is a well-mixed medium. Air from a sample site contains
a static concentration of contaminants. The concentration of contaminants depends upon the flow rate of the
contaminant into the environment, the wind speed, and the physical state of the contaminant, the terrain
contours, and temperature as a variable. The sample should be taken within 102 meters of a contaminated
surface and at the downwind edge of a contaminated area. The method should consist of pumping a given
volume of air, by hand or electric pump, through sample tubes.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> To avoid contamination, persons conducting air sampling should not use cologne, perfume,
insect repellent, medical creams, or strong soaps before taking a sample. The fragrances from these
products are volatile organic compounds that may be absorbed on the filter and skew analytical results.
Smoke also severely interferes with air sampling, therefore, avoid tobacco and vehicle exhaust smoke.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The primary method for collecting air samples is with the PAS 1000 automatic air sampler in
conjunction with a Tenax<sup><small>TM</small></sup> tube for a total of three to four minutes when possible. Upon completion of
sampling, place the Tenax<sup><small>TM</small></sup> tube in a 2¼-inch piglette. Seal the piglette around the cap with either
pressure-sensitive or Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> tape. Once sealed, place the piglette into a Mylar or reclosable bag. Fold
the bag around the piglette in a circular motion, then apply another bag and fold again. Once the bag is
folded around the piglette, use any type tape to secure the bag around the piglette. Place the piglette into a
refrigerator or cooler until the sample is transported to its destination.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> When chemicals are permitted into the atmosphere from a facility, the best places to obtain
samples are close to the emission source where the concentration of the chemical is not diluted. The further
from the original point of release, the more diluted the sample becomes from mixing with air, water, or
environmental pollutants.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Natural and man-made terrain features such as hills, valleys, and rows of buildings, sometimes
aid the collector by channeling emissions. When these features are associated with a particular facility,
their downwind side is a suitable place to collect a sample because the emission remains more concentrated
further from the release point.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> For collection in a possibly contaminated location, and if the situation permits, initially use a
detection kit such as the M18A2/M256AI to determine if a possible vapor hazard exists from known
chemical agents. Also, use the kit when personnel are required to examine possible toxic agent munitions.
In any case, collect air samples with the white-band tubes and save for identification and analysis.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> Small air samplers also enable the collector to obtain vapor samples from alleged toxic agent
munitions at a safe distance while explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations are performed. If EOD
personnel are not on the scene, the air sampler can be activated, and the collector can stand at a safe
distance while the sampler is operating.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> Perform sampling operations as soon as possible when directed by a higher headquarters or
after suspected chemical or biological contamination is encountered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-13" id="Page_B-13">[B-13]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_B-9" id="Para_B-9"></a>B-9. Collection of Water Samples</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Water sampling is a matter of collecting enough water to get acceptable information about the
contaminants. The collector should provide the analysis center with one C18 and one silica cartridge when
using the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> technique or 100 ml in a sterile bottle when Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> is not available.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> General guidelines: If it is believed that the threat has used standard chemical agents during an
attack, use the M272 chemical agent water test kit for initial screening and sampling.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> When collecting water samples using the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> C18 cartridge, the following items are
required:</p>

<ul>
<li>One 60 cc syringe without needle.</li>

<li>One 3-way sterile, plastic, stopcock with protective covers.</li>

<li>One piece of plastic tubing (3/16" inner diameter × 6" long minimum).</li>

<li>Sterile water or methanol.</li>

<li>One clean container, such as a TeflonTM cup or glass jar.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Prior to collecting each sample, prime the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> system in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Step 1.</b> Attach Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> directly to 60 cc syringe.</li>

<li><b>Step 2.</b> Pour small amount of sterile water or methanol into container.</li>

<li><b>Step 3.</b> Insert tip of Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> into container.</li>

<li><b>Step 4.</b> Withdraw at least 40 cc of solution.</li>

<li><b>Step 5.</b> Detach Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> from syringe and discard solution from syringe.</li>

<li><b>Step 6.</b> Repeat steps 3 through 5 using the same syringe.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> After priming the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, assemble the components in the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attach the 3-way stopcock to a 60 cc syringe.</li>

<li>Attach the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> to the opposite end of stopcock.</li>

<li>Attach the plastic tubing to the open end of the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Use the following procedures to collect samples with Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-14" id="Page_B-14">[B-14]</a></span><b>Step 1.</b> Ensure that the lever on the stopcock is turned sideways with the off arrow
pointed toward the large outlet port.</li>

<li><b>Step 2.</b> Place the open end of the plastic tubing into the water near the bottom, without
touching the bottom or sides of the body of water.</li>

<li><b>Step 3.</b> Draw 60 cc of water into the syringe.</li>

<li><b>Step 4.</b> Turn the stopcock lever to the off position by positioning the lever to point
toward the stopcock.</li>

<li><b>Step 5.</b> Push the plunger all the way in, discharging the water from the syringe through
the outlet port.</li>

<li><b>Step 6.</b> Repeat steps 1 through 5.</li>

<li><b>Step 7.</b> Detach a plastic tubing from the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup>, and discard it as contaminated
waste.</li>

<li><b>Step 8.</b> Detach Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> from 3-way stopcock; place into sample container; seal with
pressure-sensitive tape; and mark for Identification.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">You should take a minimum of four samples: three samples of the
suspected contamination and one control sample from a nearby
unaffected (none contaminated) area for reference.</p>
<br />
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>Step 9.</b> Dispose of the syringe and stopcock as contaminated waste.</li>

<li><b>Step 10.</b> Insert the sample container in a cooler or refrigerator until the sample is

</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> For samples to be representative of the overall contaminated area, the collection point should
be carefully selected. Collect samples from&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Drains and slow-moving streams, since contamination and dilution from other sources
are minimized.</li>

<li>Stagnant pools of water if the pools of water are part of chemical waste areas, such as
a landfill or chemical disposal area. Chemicals may percolate into stagnant pools or sumps close to the
site.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-15" id="Page_B-15">[B-15]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">If an oil film, globules of organic materials, or an unnatural appearing
powder-like material is visible on the water's surface, collect a surface
sample of the material. If not, collect the sample from near the
bottom of the water source (stream, lake, pond, water container).
The upper layers of water may have lesser amounts of contaminants,
due to higher temperatures that promote decomposition. Since most
chemicals of interest are more dense than water, contaminants usually
sink to the bottom of the water source.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> Collect the sample without the Sep-Pak<sup><small>TM</small></sup> by immersing a capped or stoppered container to the
desired depth, removing the cap or stopper, letting the container fill, and then capping the container. An
alternate method for deeper water is to use a plastic, pump-operated siphon to pump water from a specific
depth.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>i.</i> The best time to collect a sample of water from a location is when intelligence or local reports
indicate that a process of possible interest is ongoing. In the absence of reliable reporting, this may be
indicated by increased activity, higher than normal amounts of security, or increased flow from facility
chimneys or water discharge pipes. In field areas where a toxic agent has been sprayed or disseminated
over a land area, the best time to collect water samples is just after the start of a rainstorm when runoff is
beginning. Natural surface drainage will concentrate any remnants of toxic compounds in depressions,
streams, or ditches.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-10" id="Para_B-10"></a>B-10. Collection of Soil Samples</h4>

<p class="noindent">Soil is a suitable medium to collect as samples for toxic organic compounds. A critical point, however, is
that the precise site of the agent deposition must be sampled for best results. Contamination may be
recognized by discoloration or apparent deposition of material on the soil's surface. If discoloration or
deposits of material are evident, only collect the discolored soil or deposited materials, if possible. Dead,
malformed, and wilted foliage is an indicator of contamination. Soil samples should be collected from open
areas, along the drip line tents, stationary equipment, bottom of ditches and terrain depressions.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Collect the soil samples by using a knife, spoon, spatula, or similar item to scrape a square of
topsoil (2×5×1 centimeters) from areas that appear to have been contaminated in to a collection container. If
chunks or clods of earth are collected, select those that are no larger than 10×5×1 centimeters (see <a href="#TAB_B-4">Table
B-4</a>). Also, collect a control sample of soil of the same type and texture from a nearby uncontaminated
area.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Use a glass bottle, jar, or Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> jar as the container when available. When these containers
are not available, Mylar bags may be used. When using a glass bottle, jar, or Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> jar, seal the cap
with either pressure-sensitive or Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> tape, and mark for identification. When using Mylar bags, place
each sample in a separate bag, push excess air out, and seal by folding the open end over two to three times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-16" id="Page_B-16">[B-16]</a></span>
and wrapping the bag with tape. Insert the first bag into a second bag, seal, tape, and mark for identification.
If possible, place the samples in a piglette.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">CAUTION</p>

<p class="noindent">Avoid direct contact with the sample to prevent exposing yourself
to the suspect agent (MOPP 4 is required).</p>
</div>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Collect samples as soon as possible when directed, upon detection of a suspect substance, or
after the alleged incident.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-11" id="Para_B-11"></a>B-11. Collection of Contaminated Vegetation</h4>

<p class="noindent">As with soil samples, vegetation is also a suitable medium to collect as samples for toxic organic compounds.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Collect samples of vegetation that appear to be different from normal. Select leaves that have
wilted or appear to have been chemically burned. Collect samples of vegetation that appear to have liquid
or solid substances deposited on their surfaces (this may be noticed as a shiny or moist area).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Collect samples of vegetation at several locations within the suspected contaminated area.
Using a cutting tool or any sharp object, cut several affected leaves and/or a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'handsful'">handful</ins> of grass whenever
possible. Do not crush the sample. Place the sample into a Mylar or reclosable bag. Squeeze excess air out
of the bag and seal it. Fold the open end of the Mylar bag over two to three times, and wrap it with tape.
The minimum size for a sample is three leaves or three handsful of grass. One leaf is of little value, but is
better than nothing. Bark is acceptable but not preferred. Mark the bag for identification. Take a control
sample of similar material from an unaffected (uncontaminated) area. Fold, seal, tape, and mark the control
sample in the same manner as the actual sample.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> When it is possible to determine a probable center of attack in an area, collect vegetation
samples near the center of the area, about 100 meters upwind of the area, and in several 100-meter
increments downwind of the area. If the collector can discern a contamination pattern in the area, this
should be reported.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-12" id="Para_B-12"></a>B-12. Medical Specimens</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Just as blood and urine specimens are taken from humans who were allegedly exposed in an
attack, also collect specimens from individuals who claim not to be affected by a toxic agent and are from
the same group as exposed personnel. The purpose is the same as collecting environmental control
specimens; that is, to determine if a toxic substance is present in the individuals' natural environment or if it
has been artificially introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-17" id="Page_B-17">[B-17]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Selection of humans for control sampling is somewhat more complicated than selection of
environmental control samples. This is because ethnic diets, racial differences, physiological makeup, and
actual living conditions of persons who are outwardly similar may introduce potentially large deviations.
Each of these factors must be accurately considered before selecting subjects as controls.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Consideration of ethnic diets is important because of unique foods or methods of food
preparation that may exist. As an example, individuals in settled areas may purchase beer that has been
carefully filtered and sterilized, while individuals in a nearby unsettled area may ferment their own beer by
burying home crafted jugs in the ground and extracting the product little by little over several months.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Racial differences can account for differences in mortality and morbidity rates in specific
populations. One example of this could be the high rate of hemophilia in a population versus the rarity of
the disease in another.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Physiological makeup is critical because of the differences in hormone balance and tissue
composition in males, females, adults, and juveniles. For this reason, medical control specimens should be
drawn from individuals of the same gender and approximate age as specimens from exposed personnel, if
possible.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Differences in the actual living conditions of people also require a close look. The point here
is that conditions in remote, semicivilized camps are seldom the same as those in a well-established camp
that has access to modern amenities.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> The bottom line in selecting subjects for medical control sampling is that they be as similar in
all aspects as possible.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-13" id="Para_B-13"></a>B-13. Collection of Medical Specimens</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Trained medical technicians or physicians should collect medical specimens (human or animal);
however, Special Forces NBC Reconnaissance team personnel are trained to do this procedure. Remember,
the collector must have express permission (authority) to collect medical specimens from the dead, because
of religious beliefs in many cultures. To obtain such specimens without permission may result in unnecessary
mission complications. Ensure all personnel handling or collecting medical specimens have received proper
immunizations for their own protection. They must be inoculated IAW The Surgeon General's guidance.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Medical specimens collected during an investigation include blood, urine, sputum, nasal
swabs, and tissue specimens from living victims and blood and urine specimens from unexposed persons
(background control specimens).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Collect blood specimens using either a standard 10 cc disposable syringe with a 1- to 1½-inch
needle (20 to 22 gauge), or by using a Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup> system. When using a Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup> system, ensure
that multiple specimen needles and "red top" vacuum tubes are used. Ten cc of blood is sufficient for
analytical testing. Do not take more than 5 cc from small, malnourished children. After blood is collected,
it should be transferred to a polypropylene-type container and sealed with parafilm before transporting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-18" id="Page_B-18">[B-18]</a></span>
All body fluids should be collected without violating antiseptic techniques. Also, prior to transporting
specimens, collectors need to check specimen containers for paper labels IAW guidelines for labeling
medical specimens. Collect blood specimens using the following materials equipment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gloves.</li>

<li>10 cc sterile, disposable syringe.</li>

<li>1- to 1.5-inch sterile needle (20 to 22 gauge).</li>

<li>Vacutainer<sup><small>TM</small></sup> device (adapter with needle).</li>

<li>Constricting band.</li>

<li>Disinfectant pads, Betadine, or alcohol.</li>

<li>Sterile 2×2-inch gauze pads.</li>

<li>Labels.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Gloves should be worn whenever handling medical specimens. Do
not freeze liquid blood and urine specimens (ideal cooling temperature
is between 35° and 40°F [2° to 4°C].)</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Collect urine specimens using either a standard urine cup or by a urine catheter and urine cup.
When collecting the specimen directly into a urine cup, the person must urinate into the cup until sufficient
fluid is collected (40 cc of urine is preferable, although 10 cc can support analytical testing). When the
person is unable to urinate, the catheterization technique is preferable. The catheterization technique is best
performed in a clinical environment. As with other body fluids collected, urine must be kept cold. Do not
freeze.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">For correct procedures on catheterization refer to STP 8-91W15-SM-TG.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Collect tissue specimens using sterile scissors and forceps or as directed by the attending
physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-19" id="Page_B-19">[B-19]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) When casualties have unidentified skin lesions, photographs of the lesion(s) and overall
photos of the extent of the lesion(s) should be taken, using color film before biopsy. A specimen of the
lesion should be obtained. This is done by surgically removing a portion of the skin with a sterile pair of
scissors and forceps.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Place tissue specimens in a Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> container filled ¼ inch from the bottom with a
preservative, (formalin 10%) for preservation of the specimen until it reaches its proper destination. Seal
the container and lid with parafilm. As with any other medical specimens, tissue specimens are refrigerated
prior to shipment; but do not freeze tissue specimens.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Collect nasal swabs by using a cotton-tipped swab. Place the swab with collected specimen in
a Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> container filled ¼ inch from the bottom with a preservative for preservation of the specimen
until it reaches its destination. Seal the container and lid with parafilm. Refrigerate the specimen for
shipment, but do not freeze.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> Collect sputum by having the patient discharge the sputum into a small, sterile screw-top jar or
urine specimen cup. Seal the container and refrigerate the specimen for shipment, but do not freeze.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-14" id="Para_B-14"></a>B-14. Post mortem Specimens</h4>

<p class="noindent">Post mortem specimens should be collected by individuals trained in forensics. When forensics-trained
individuals are not available, the most qualified medical person should collect human specimens. Specimens
from animals should be collected by veterinary personnel. In either case, the following specimens are
collected:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Blood.</b> Use a 50 to 60 cc sterile syringe with an 18-gauge, 5-inch (large bore) needle to
collect blood from the heart, and urine directly from the bladder. Use a spinal needle to collect cerebral
spinal fluids. Three of each type of specimens must be collected.</li>

<li><b>Lungs.</b> A biopsy needle is needed to properly collect lung tissue specimens. After collecting
specimens from the lungs, place specimens in a plastic or Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> container filled with 10% formalin
(preservative) and seal the container for transporting to its destination.</li>

<li><b>Liver.</b> If possible collect liver core specimens, using a large-gauge needle (18-gauge, 5-inch
long) via intercostal or abdominal puncture. Or, if the family consents, perform a minilaparotomy and
obtain one or two 2×2×2 cm sections of liver. Store and package the specimen as directed for tissue
specimens. For suspect biological agents, see <a href="#TAB_B-1">Table B-1</a> for specific types of specimens, amount, collection
medium, and from whom to collect.</li>
</ul>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Before attempting any of the above procedures, collector must be
certified by a qualified person (medical doctor) on the correct procedures
to collect specimens from cadavers.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_B-15" id="Para_B-15"></a>B-15. Reporting, Packaging, and Shipment</h4>

<p class="noindent">Although a sample/specimen collected from an alleged attack area can be significant, it can become useless
if proper steps are not taken to record critical information about its collection or if it is improperly packed
and breaks during shipment to an analysis center. This section discusses the information needed when
acquiring samples/specimens and the preferred methods for handling and packing samples/specimens for
shipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-21" id="Page_B-21">[B-21]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> A complete background information history of the circumstances about each sample's/specimen's
acquisition must be provided to the agency analyzing the sample/specimen.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Critical background information includes&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Circumstances of acquisition. How the sample/specimen was obtained, where it was
found, and how it was collected.</li>

<li>Physical description. The physical state (solid, liquid, powder, apparent viscosity),
color, approximate size, identity of the specimen (such as military nomenclature), dirt, leaves, or so forth.</li>

<li>Circumstances of agent deposition. The type of delivery system, a description of how
the weapon functioned, how the agent acted on release, sounds heard during dissemination, a description of
any craters or shrapnel found associated with a burst, and colors of smoke, flames, or mist that may be
associated with the attack.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Provide information on the agent effects on vegetation for soil or environmental samples. A
description of the general area (jungle, mountain, grassland) and changes in the vegetation after agent
deposition (such as color change, wilting, drying, dead) in the main attack and fringe areas.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Provide information on the agent effects on humans for medical specimens. Describe how the
agent affected personnel in the main attack area versus fringe areas; the duration of agent effects; peculiar
odors that may have been noticed in the area prior to, during, and/or after an attack; measures taken that
alleviated or deteriorated the effects; and the approximate number of victims and survivors, to include their
ages and genders.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Describe the agent effects on animals. Provide information on the types of animals that were
or were not affected by an attack and of how they were affected.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-16" id="Para_B-16"></a>B-16. Handling and Packaging Materials</h4>

<p class="noindent">Materials used for packaging samples/specimens primarily consist of Mylar collection bags, Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup>
specimen jars and tubes, pigs and piglettes, ice chests, sealing materials, and wrapping and cushioning
supplies.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <i>Collection Bag.</i> Use the Mylar bag as the initial container for such samples as protective
masks and filter canisters, individual antidote and decon kits, munition fragments, and other items too large
to place in a specimen jar. Use it also to package sample/specimen containers to ensure a vapor barrier in
case the container is broken in transit. The bag acts as an initial or secondary vapor barrier to prevent air
from leaking inward and toxic material outward. Follow the procedures below when using the bag.</p>

<ul>
<li>If packaging a specimen container or nonenvironmental sample/specimen, first, verify
it has a sample/specimen number. Carefully place the sample/specimen in a bottom corner of the Mylar
bag.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-22" id="Page_B-22">[B-22]</a></span>
Squeeze all the air out of the bag and seal it by removing the adhesive's protective strip,
and pressing the two sides together.</li>

<li>Place a piece of 2-inch-wide fiber or cloth tape across the end of the bag that you just
sealed to reseal the Mylar bag on the outside. This serves as extra insurance in case the internal seal is
broken.</li>

<li>With the bag lying in front of you and the seal at the top, fold the bag across its width to
as small a size as possible without damaging the sample/specimen. At this point, use tape to hold the fold.
Next, fold the bag from the top down to the bottom of the bag to as small a size as possible. The sealing of
the bag is the most critical step during the packaging process.</li>

<li>At this point, turn the bag over and use a marker or file label to put the sample/specimen
number on the outside of the bag so that analysis center personnel can identify the sample/specimen.</li>

<li>Place the folded Mylar bag in a clear plastic reclosable bag, if available. Following the
same steps you used for the Mylar bag, fold and seal the plastic bag. When this has been completed, again
mark the sample/specimen number on the exterior of the bag.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <i>Glass Specimen Jars and Polypropylene Tubes.</i> Use glass containers to hold small environmental
samples, water samples, and medical and post mortem specimens. Use polypropylene containers to
hold medical specimens such as blood or urine. Polypropylene containers may be used for post mortem
specimens if required; however, glass containers are preferred. The use of glass rather than plastic
containers is preferred for environmental samples because toxic agents may leach chemicals from plastics
into a sample, introducing contamination and confusing the analysis efforts.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the container has a screw-on lid, place Teflon<sup><small>TM</small></sup> plumber's tape (NSN 8030-00-889-3535;
Tape, Antiseize) on the threads of the container before putting on the lid. This helps to limit the
leakage of liquids and vapor from the container and to assure the lid will not fall off while in transit. If the
lid has a cardboard liner, remove the liner and replace it with one or two layers of parafilm (a laboratory
sealant film).</li>

<li>Once the lid is on, stretch parafilm around the outside of the container at the junction of
the lid and the glass. Two wraps of the film are enough to provide a leakage barrier and more assurance
that the lid cannot fall off.</li>

<li>At this point, ensure the sample/specimen number is on the outside of the container. Use
a diamond etching pencil or an adhesive label to put the sample/specimen number on the exterior of the
container.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <i>Six-Pound Metal Can.</i> Use metal cans as the external container for packaging small items that
have been sealed in Mylar bags, specimen jars, and polypropylene tubes containing medical specimens.
The metal can helps absorb shock from rough handling during shipment and eliminates the spread of
contamination if a specimen container is broken. The six-pound metal can is capable of holding more than
one sample/specimen (depending upon size of samples/specimens).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-23" id="Page_B-23">[B-23]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Before placing samples/specimens in the can for shipping, ensure a sample/specimen
number is assigned and is visible on each item.</li>

<li>Place about 1 to 2 inches of packing material in the bottom of the can.</li>

<li>Wrap jars and tubes in plastic bubble wrap or ⅛- to ¼-inch-thick foam rubber sheeting,
secure the wrap with tape or a rubber band, and place the wrapped item in the can.</li>

<li>If bubble wrap or foam rubber is not available, use newspaper. The guiding principle is
that the sample/specimen containers should fit snugly and not be able to move in the can.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Ice Chest.</i> Standard polyethylene or metal ice chests are the most easily procured items used
for transworld shipment of CB samples/specimens. The most easily used size is about 24 inches long by 18
inches high by 15 inches deep. This size permits the sender to ship two or three 6-pound metal cans in each
chest with sufficient dry ice to maintain freezing temperatures for about four days. Also, each chest
remains at a weight that one individual can handle.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <i>Transport Container.</i> When the samples/specimens must be transported on commercial
aircraft, an IATA-approved sample transport container must be used for shipment/delivery to the CONUS
laboratory.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> <i>Coolants.</i> Samples/specimens submitted for laboratory analysis must be properly packaged,
labeled, and shipped to ensure they arrive in an analytically acceptable condition. All samples should be
maintained at a temperature of 1° to 4°C during transport. Ideally, samples/specimens should arrive at the
in-theater laboratory within 6 hours of collection. The samples/specimens should be delivered to the
CONUS laboratory within 24 to 48 hours. If the samples/specimens cannot be delivered to the CONUS
laboratory within this time, then they should be flash frozen to -165°C, if capabilities are available. If
available, dry ice should be used when flash freezing cannot be accomplished. If the samples/specimens
cannot be delivered to the CONUS laboratory within 24 hours, the supporting laboratory should subculture
the samples/specimens and send the subculture with the samples/specimens to the CONUS laboratory. The
subculturing date should also be provided.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> <i>Internal Insulation.</i> While a commercial ice chest provides good insulation of both the
samples/specimens and the coolant, it is best to place extra insulation and cushioning around the metal cans
inside the chest. Newspapers, plastic bubble wrap, and foam rubber may all be used with almost equally
good results except newspapers and standard ice do not mix well.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_B-17" id="Para_B-17"></a>B-17. Collection Reporting</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The collector must provide a formatted message for transmission as soon as possible to report
acquisition and shipment of samples/specimens. During special operations in a theater in which a Special
Forces Group (SFG) is deployed, the message is transmitted by the fastest means through the fewest
channels to the NBC control (NBCC) center. If a NBCC center has not been deployed to the area of
operations, as in low-sample/specimen volume peacetime NBC sampling operation, the message is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B-24" id="Page_B-24">[B-24]</a></span>
transmitted by the fastest means through the fewest channels to the message addressees below. In addition,
a written report accompanies each sample/specimen or batch of samples/specimens. The collector ensures
that the acquisition message has been properly classified.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The collection report includes at least the following addressees:</p>

<h2><span class="ch"><a name="APP_C" id="APP_C"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">APPENDIX C</a></span><br /><br />

GUIDELINES FOR OPERATIONAL PLANNING
FOR HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT IN A
NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_C-1" id="Para_C-1"></a>C-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">As the HSS unit prepares for its support role, NBC, TIM, and CBRNE considerations must be included.
This appendix provides guidelines for HSS planning, preparing for, and conducting operations in an NBC
environment and responding to a homeland defense CBRNE event.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_C-2" id="Para_C-2"></a>C-2. Predeployment</h4>

<p class="noindent">When preparing the unit's mobilization plan and TSOP, include the supplies and equipment that will be
required for the unit to operate in an NBC environment. DO NOT wait until ordered to mobilize to begin
preparation for the mission. A well-prepared and trained unit stands a much better chance of surviving and
accomplishing their assigned mission. At a minimum include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nerve agent pretreatment and antidotes (see FM 8-285).</li>

<li>Blister agent antidote/treatment (see FM 8-285).</li>

<li>Incapacitating agent treatment (see FM 8-285).</li>

<li>Lung-damaging agents (choking agents) treatment (see FM 8-285).</li>

<li>Blood agent (cyanogen) treatment (see FM 8-285).</li>

<li>Biological agent immunizations and chemoprophylaxis (see FM 8-284).</li>

<li>Biological agent treatment (see FM 8-284).</li>

<li>Nuclear and radiological treatment (see FM 4-02.283).</li>

<li>Protective mask with hood for each individual (see FM 3-4).</li>

<li>Replacement filters for protective mask (see FM 3-4).</li>

<li>Two sets of MOPP per individual assigned to unit (see FM 3-4).</li>

<li>All authorized radiation detection equipment.</li>

<li>All authorized chemical agent detection equipment.</li>

<li>All authorized NBC alarm systems.</li>

<li>Biological agent detection equipment, if available.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_C-2" id="Page_C-2">[C-2]</a></span>
Sample/specimen collection, packaging, and shipping supplies for suspect NBC agents.</li>

</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_C-3" id="Para_C-3"></a>C-3. Mobilization</h4>

<p class="noindent">During mobilization the unit must ensure that all supplies and equipment are on hand and are serviceable.
Commanders and leaders must also ensure that&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Movement plans are prepared.</li>

<li>Transportation support requirements are identified and requested.</li>

<li>Load plans include provisions for the transportation of NBC supplies and equipment (medical
and nonmedical).</li>

<li>A MOPP level has been established for the movement, if applicable.</li>

<li>A checklist of training shortfalls is prepared and a training plan is in place.[3]</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_C-3" id="Page_C-3">[C-3]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_C-4" id="Para_C-4"></a>C-4. Establish a Medical Treatment Facility</h4>

<p class="noindent">Plans for establishing a BAS, DCS, or FST for operating in a NBC environment must include employment
of CBPS systems. When establishing a hospital using Deployable Medical Systems (DEPMEDS), the
chemically protected (CP) DEPMEDS must be set up as the conventional shelters are being set up. Once
the conventional shelter has been set up and is operational, CP DEPMEDS cannot be established without
first taking down the existing shelter. Follow the technical manual provided with the CP DEPMEDS
system issued to your unit. Plans for operating a DEPMEDS equipped hospital in the NBC environment
should include, but not be limited to&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Coordinating with the supported unit to ensure unit casualty collecting points and patient
decontamination points are on the HSS template. If possible, integrate HSS units/elements into local units
NBC detection systems and communications systems.</li>

<li>Surveying the AO. Survey the area to ensure contamination is not present before establishing
the MTF.</li>

<li>Establishing detection stations on the unit's perimeter.</li>

<li>Determining direction of prevailing wind. All contaminated patients, ambulances, and
helicopters must arrive on the downwind side of the MTF; this must be done with or without CPS.</li>

<li>Setting up the contaminated triage, patient decontamination, and contaminated treatment areas
(including overhead cover).</li>

<li>Establishing the contaminated ambulance point.</li>

<li>Establishing the contaminated helicopter landing area.</li>

<li>Preparing the contaminated waste dump.</li>

<li>Establishing the clean ambulance point.</li>

<li>Establishing the clean helicopter landing area.</li>

<li>Marking the hot line and preparing the shuffle pit.</li>

<li>Employing CP DEPMEDS system (close shelter, turn on CB filtration units, close air locks,
and maintain overpressure), if available.</li>

<li>Establishing the clean treatment area 30 to 50 yards (meters) upwind of hot line, when CPS is
not available.</li>

<li>Ensuring provisions for overhead cover at the patient decontamination area.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_C-4" id="Page_C-4">[C-4]</a></span>
Requesting patient decontamination personnel from supported units for the BAS and DCS, or
from units located within the geographic area for hospitals.</li>

<li>Requesting issue of chemical patient treatment and chemical patient decontamination MESs, if
not on-hand.</li>

<li>Establishing contamination monitoring procedures in CPS.</li>

<li>Establishing control procedures for personnel crossing the hot line (through the shuffle pit).</li>

<li>Establishing CPS entry and exit control procedures (see <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a>).</li>

<li>Making improvisations; if the MTF must operate in a nuclear/radiological environment. For
optional improvisations, see <a href="#APP_H">Appendix H.</a></li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_C-5" id="Para_C-5"></a>C-5. Operate a Medical Treatment Facility Receiving Contaminated Patients</h4>

<p class="noindent">Individuals should have decontaminated themselves or have been decontaminated by unit personnel;
however, an MTF must plan for and be prepared to receive contaminated patients. The patients may not
have been decontaminated at the unit, or they may have become contaminated en route to the MTF.
Selected CSHs may be designated as the primary NBC MTF and be augmented with additional supplies and
medical staff. When designated as such, plans must be prepared designating the location of the CSH that
can best support the forward deployed MTFs. All actions listed in paragraph C-4 must be taken. During
operations, actions that must be taken are&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Establishing a MOPP level commensurate with the operation.</li>

<li>Requiring all ambulances and helicopters with contaminated (or suspected) patients to stay
downwind of the MTF.</li>

<li>Conducting initial triage, decontamination, and contaminated treatment downwind of the clean
treatment area (<a href="#APP_F">Appendixes F</a> <a href="#APP_H">and H</a>).</li>

<li>Ensuring all personnel crossing the hot line are decontaminated.</li>

<li>Monitoring personnel entering clean area to ensure that they are contamination free.</li>

<li>Monitoring for contamination in the clean treatment area (with or without CPS).</li>

<li>Establishing an internal monitoring program to periodically verify that the MTF is
contamination free.</li>

<li>Monitoring CPS for entry of contamination.</li>

MEDICAL PLANNING GUIDE FOR THE ESTIMATION
OF NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL
BATTLE CASUALTIES</h2>

<h3>Section I. INTRODUCTION</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_D-1" id="Para_D-1"></a>D-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">The primary purpose of the Medical Planning Guide for the Estimation of Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Battle Casualties&mdash;AMedP-8(A), a three-volume publication for NBC, is to assist medical planners, medical
logisticians, and medical staff officers in predicting NBC warfare contingency requirements for HSS
personnel, medical materiel stockpiles, patient transport or evacuation capabilities, and facilities needed for
patient decontamination, triage, treatment, and supportive care. The optional use of these guides is for
projecting medical NBC operational estimates at brigade, division, corps, and EAC.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The use of "the guide" in this appendix refers to AMedP-8(A),
Volume I, II, or III. The AMedP-8(A), Volume I, II, or III, is the
text for each of the STANAGs. The contents of this appendix are
extracts from Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the guide.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_D-2" id="Para_D-2"></a>D-2. Medical Planners' Tool</h4>

<p class="noindent">Medical planners' estimates (such as casualty, logistics, evacuation, and personnel cross leveling) must be
modified for the NBC environment. Estimates of NBC medical workload can be found in AMedP-8(A). A
compact disk containing these documents and an automated version of AMedP-8(A), the Casualty
Requirements Estimation Tool (CREST), can be obtained from Headquarters, Department of the Army,
ATTN: DASG-HCZ-FD, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3258. The CREST is primarily an
Army tool focusing on corps, brigades, and battalions, but also models aerial ports of debarkation, seaports
of debarkation, and other units.</p>

<h3>Section II. MEDICAL PLANNING GUIDE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF
NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL BATTLE CASUALTIES
(NUCLEAR)&mdash;AMedP-8(A), VOLUME I</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_D-3" id="Para_D-3"></a>D-3. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Volume I of the guide provides estimates of casualties and remaining operational strength after
a nuclear detonation in a brigade-sized unit during an out-of-area contingency operation. These estimates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-2" id="Page_D-2">[D-2]</a></span>
include the numbers, injury type (initial nuclear radiation, blast, and thermal injuries), and injury severity
of nuclear patients based on several brigade scenarios. The scenarios include three different brigade-sized
units, in warned or unwarned posture, which have single detonation of 5, 20, or 50 KT in the unit
area.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The guide is organized into 10 sections. Section 1 introduces the guide and presents
background and medical planning considerations. Section 2 provides information on the methodology used
to develop the estimates of fatalities, casualties, and effectiveness of individuals remaining in the unit.
Section 3 explores the use of the casualty prediction tables based on combat effectiveness decrements and
estimates of the number of casualties categorized by insult level. Sections 4 through 10 contain tables of
casualty estimates.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> A sample of this information is graphically depicted in Tables 1-1 and 1-2 of the guide.
The casualty estimates used to prepare these tables are presented in the guide as Tables 6-4 and 10-4 in
Sections 6 and 10 respectively. The use of these tables is explained in paragraphs 3.1 through 3.6 of the
guide. Paragraphs 3.7 and 3.8 of the guide discuss how to use the guide for situations not explicitly
addressed.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> The effects of residual radiation on personnel are not included in the guide. AMedP-6 and
AMedP-7 provide information on planning, operations, and treatment for a residual radiation situation.
Also not included is the impact of tumbling; impact of glass shards from windows of vehicles or buildings;
crushing deaths from building failure; or COSC casualties; thus causing underestimations on the number of
patients. Further, there will be personnel who get radiation doses or burns and do not seek medical care.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> A nuclear detonation may introduce new levels of destruction to the battlefield. There is very
little experience with nuclear effects and there is certainly no experience with these weapons on a modern,
highly technological battlefield. Therefore, there is little historical data on which to base estimates of
personnel injured. Computer simulations are generally used to estimate numbers of personnel injured.
Although these estimates may include significant uncertainty, they provide the best estimates to date.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-4" id="Para_D-4"></a>D-4. Medical Planning Considerations</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> For effective mass casualty management, key medical and related considerations must be well
planned and practiced. These include on-site triage and emergency care, communications, health service
logistics, evacuation by ground and air resources, and personnel training in self-aid/buddy aid. Plans need
to be made for requirements that may differ from the usual combat situation. For example, in combat
situations, severe burn injuries in large numbers are relatively uncommon. Therefore, no special planning
for the care of large numbers of burn patients is required. In a nuclear environment, this may not be true,
and consideration must be given to the increased need for medical support that would result from a high
incidence of burn patients.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Prior to an attack, the data may be used by medical planners to augment the requirements for
conventional combat as appropriate for the nuclear situation. The tables can be used to prepare estimates of
the number of patients at all echelons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-3" id="Page_D-3">[D-3]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> After an attack, the effectiveness and adequacy of the medical support effort during the first 24
hours are critical. Commanders should be informed rapidly of the estimated medical load in order to
provide rescue and treatment resources or request assistance from higher headquarters, adjacent units, or
allied units. These estimates should be updated postattack based on aerial or ground reconnaissance and
survey.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> In addition to casualties, a nuclear weapon detonation can generate an EMP that may cause
catastrophic failures of electronic equipment components and may adversely affect the capability of all units
in the area of the detonation. Electromagnetic pulse has no direct effect on personnel and is not further
addressed in this publication.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-5" id="Para_D-5"></a>D-5. Triage</h4>

<p class="noindent">Since a nuclear detonation may produce mass casualties, plans for a triage system must be in place.
Paragraphs 3.4 through 3.5 of the guide describe patient categories by injury severity and may be used to
estimate the number and injury severity of patients for a particular operational scenario. The guide does
not, however, provide estimates of the number of patients by triage classification.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-6" id="Para_D-6"></a>D-6. Evacuation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> An efficient and flexible evacuation plan is absolutely essential for the preservation of life and
to retain the mobility of forward medical resources. In a potential mass casualty situation, the full range of
evacuation assets should be considered.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The extended hospital time of nuclear casualties will influence levels of evacuation or
hospitalization. In addition, estimates of the different types of casualties can be a consideration in evacuation
planning. In planning for evacuation, estimates provided in the guide can be used as a starting point from
which to estimate evacuation resources.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-7" id="Para_D-7"></a>D-7. In-Unit Care</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Some personnel within the military unit may not be classified medically as casualties, but will
require some self-aid and buddy aid. A casualty is defined as anyone entering the medical system.
Paragraph 2.5 of the guide further describes the basis for casualty calculation.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Nuclear detonations will produce a large number of blast, burn, and projectile injuries that
initially must be treated by individual soldiers trained in first aid procedures. The physical damage to the
surrounding area as a result of a nuclear detonation will increase delays in medical assistance and evacuation.
Training in self-aid/buddy aid will improve casualty survival rates and conserve medical resources. The
guide can be used to provide a conservative estimate of the numbers of injured that will require first aid.
The tables in Sections 4 through 10 of the guide, showing the status of unit personnel by time period, can be
used to indicate the numbers of personnel who are injured (but not casualties) who may require first aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-4" id="Page_D-4">[D-4]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_D-8" id="Para_D-8"></a>D-8. Hospital Bed Requirements</h4>

<p class="noindent">The data provided in the guide can be used to determine immediate additional bed requirements resulting
from a nuclear detonation. In addition to the numbers of patients who will need beds, the data provided in
the guide can also indicate the increased hospitalization time of nuclear casualties. Long-term bed
requirements, greater than 30 days, are not provided. Based on the theater evacuation policy specified for
the operation, the hospital bed days may be in theater or in CONUS.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-9" id="Para_D-9"></a>D-9. Medical Logistics</h4>

<p class="noindent">The data provided in the guide can assist in estimating the needed supplies. The supply system must be
prepared for increased demands for certain types of medical and general supplies and equipment, kits,
dressings, and antibiotics. The treatment of combined injuries will not require any special types of supplies,
although demands for certain types of supplies will increase.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-10" id="Para_D-10"></a>D-10. Medical Force Planning</h4>

<p class="noindent">The assignment of medical support is normally based upon the total military population and the expected
conventional casualty rate. The data provided in the guide may be used to assess the requirement for
additional medical units. The planning guidance presented in this document can (and should) be modified to
reflect the needs of the anticipated operation, including operational tempo, national/coalition priorities,
medical resource allotment, and so forth. When trying to augment personnel, consider that the use of a
nuclear weapon in a tactical situation could be an indication of an increased tempo of warfare. Therefore,
even though a unit may be targeted with a nuclear detonation, that unit may not be the site where the highest
numbers of casualties are being produced, and another unit may have priority of support.</p>

<h3>Section III. MEDICAL PLANNING GUIDE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF
NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL BATTLE CASUALTIES
(BIOLOGICAL)&mdash;AMedP-8(A), VOLUME II</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_D-11" id="Para_D-11"></a>D-11. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">The guide, AMedP-8(A), Volume II, provides estimates of casualties, and remaining operational strength,
after single BW attacks on tactically deployed, brigade-sized land force units, offshore naval and marine
forces, and selected strategic targets in rear areas. These worst-case casualty estimates are for personnel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-5" id="Page_D-5">[D-5]</a></span>
within both the targeted and the downwind hazard areas of the attacked forces. They assume that all
affected personnel will be unsheltered and unwarned. To further estimate worst-case outcomes, the guide
assumes that exposed individuals have not been vaccinated against any of the evaluated agents, nor have
they undergone any type of medical prophylactic treatment prior to exposure. The tables included in the
guide are designed to show numbers of expected casualties; expected fatalities; personnel at different
performance levels; and times after exposure. In selected scenarios, the guide provides a method for
estimating casualties among collocated civilians based on local population density.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The guide presents casualty estimates for all possible combinations of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eleven operational scenarios.</li>

<li>Seven biological agents.</li>

<li>Four types of delivery systems.</li>

<li>Three attack intensities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The guide is subject to limitations of extent and content. Since there are many more possible
attack variables than those considered, the guide presents a limited number of estimates and provisional
guidance for estimating cases not modeled. These estimates are based upon the best available medical data,
but such data result in qualified estimates. Therefore, for more authoritative medical descriptions, medical
planners and staff personnel should use FM 8-9, NATO Handbook on the Medical Aspects of NBC
Defensive Operations, AMedP-6(B), Part II&mdash;Biological. Users of the guide must amplify or modify these
estimates to meet emergent requirements such as injuries resulting from combined biological and conventional
attacks.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Computer models that integrate available information have been used to predict the effects of
future biological attacks. These resultant estimates may include substantial uncertainties when applied to
specific situations. However, they provide the best estimates available to date.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> The guide is also organized into 10 sections. Section 1 introduces features of the guide, and
then presents background and medical planning considerations. Section 2 provides information on the
methodology used to develop the estimates. Section 3 describes how to use the tables presented in the
guide. Sections 4 through 10 of the guide contain tables of casualty estimates, with one section for each of
the seven biological agents.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Biological attacks are likely to have a significant impact on the medical system. As detailed
elsewhere in the guide, victims may number in the hundreds or even thousands. Demand for medical care
may quickly overwhelm available resources; this problem will be exacerbated if medical personnel
themselves become victims of the attack. Local civilian populations will be victimized as well, limiting
host-nation support and potentially adding to the demands on the military medical system.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> A variety of medical responses to BW attacks are available, depending on the agent used and
whether medical countermeasures are employed prior to attack or after exposure has already occurred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-6" id="Page_D-6">[D-6]</a></span>
For many agents, immunization or pre-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics may prevent illness in those
subsequently exposed. After exposure, disease can often be prevented or ameliorated via immunization and
therapeutic use of antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and hyperimmune gammaglobulins.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-12" id="Para_D-12"></a>D-12. Medical Planning Considerations</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Effective mass casualty management requires careful planning. The guide is designed to support
such planning by providing medical planners and staff personnel with a systematic means for estimating
the number of biological casualties. However, casualty management also involves practice of self-aid and
buddy aid, on-site triage and emergency care, decontamination, transport to medical facilities, infection
control measures, communications, health services, logistics, and evacuation by ground or air transportation.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Medical requirements resulting from attacks with biological agents may be substantially
different from those resulting from conventional, nuclear, or chemical combat. There would be no indication
of the presence of biological agents in most tactical situations. Units downwind from an attack area may be
unexpectedly exposed to biological agents. In some cases, there will also be a risk of secondary infection
and subsequent epidemics amongst troops and/or the local population. Additionally, use of biological
agents may generate reservoirs within the local animal population that may serve as a further source of
infection.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Often the first indication of an attack with a biological agent will be the development of
symptoms in exposed personnel. Diagnosis and treatment are complicated by the fact that many of the
agent-induced diseases described in the guide begin with symptoms associated with common illnesses, such
as influenza. In such cases, biological agent attacks may generally be distinguished from naturally occurring
epidemics by the sudden onset of disease, the large number of personnel presenting with similar symptoms,
and the concentration of those personnel in geographically contaminated areas.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-13" id="Para_D-13"></a>D-13. Triage</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Since a biological attack may produce mass casualties, preparations for a triage system should
be in place before the attack. Paragraph 3.3.8 of the guide describes patient categories by illness severity.
For a particular described operational scenario, this information may be used to estimate the number of
patients with specified levels of illness. The guide does not provide estimates of the number of patients by
triage classification or usual medical descriptions.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Decontamination of patients must be considered before further evacuation.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-14" id="Para_D-14"></a>D-14. Evacuation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> An efficient and flexible evacuation plan is essential for adequate casualty treatment and to
retain mobility of forward medical resources. For an assessment of a potential mass casualty situation, the
medical planner should consider the full range of evacuation assets, limitations, and obstacles. After an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-7" id="Page_D-7">[D-7]</a></span>
attack, the medical staff may need to estimate the number of casualties that could require evacuation at
given postexposure times.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Evacuation requirements will vary with the type of biological agent used. Casualties resulting
from some agents may not be evacuated because the time course of effects is relatively short. For others,
like botulinum toxin, casualties may require evacuation to a facility where they can receive care for weeks
or even months. Estimates provided in the guide can be used as a starting point from which to plan for
evacuation resources, including those required for decontamination of personnel and transportation assets.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-15" id="Para_D-15"></a>D-15. In-Unit Care</h4>

<p class="noindent">The casualty estimates in the guide are presented without allowance for in-unit care. However, there may
be need for rapid intervention. Delays in obtaining medical care may occur because of physical damage or
contamination of the surrounding area. Soldiers trained in first aid procedures may be the first to provide
aid to biological agent casualties. The guide provides a conservative estimate of the numbers of exposed
personnel who will require first aid. The tables described in paragraphs 3.3.2 through 3.3.4 of the guide
give the time courses of effects that may apply to estimation of in-unit care and delayed medical
requirements.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-16" id="Para_D-16"></a>D-16. Patient Bed Requirements</h4>

<p class="noindent">Bed requirements can be estimated using the tables described in paragraphs 3.3.2 through 3.3.4 of the
guide. The latter type of table is useful after an attack since it shows gains and losses of casualties over
time. The type of table described in paragraph 3.3.5 of the guide may be more useful for long-range
planning. It shows maximum numbers of personnel by illness severity category. The tables in the guide
only provide estimates for the first 35 days after attack. Based on the theater evacuation policy specified for
the operation, hospital days may be in theater or in the national area.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-17" id="Para_D-17"></a>D-17. Medical Logistics</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The estimates provided in the guide are intended to support projections of medical materiel
and logistical requirements. Increased demands may occur for certain types of medical and general
supplies, including equipment, kits, antibiotics, disinfectants, and other critical medical materiel. Demands
may also increase for items unique to the prevention and treatment of biological agent casualties, such as
vaccines, antibiotics, and antisera, as well as items adapted to contaminated environments. Tables showing
maximum numbers of personnel by illness severity category can provide useful input for logistical planning.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Often the first indication of an attack with a biological agent will be the development of
symptoms in exposed personnel. Diagnosis and treatment are complicated by the fact that many of the
agent-induced diseases described in the guide begin with symptoms associated with common illnesses, such
as influenza. In such cases, biological agent attacks may generally be distinguished from naturally occurring
diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-8" id="Page_D-8">[D-8]</a></span></p>

<h4><a name="Para_D-18" id="Para_D-18"></a>D-18. Medical Force Planning</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The assignment of medical support is normally based upon the total military population and
the expected conventional casually rate. The guide may be used to assess requirements for additional
medical units.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Although a specific unit may be the target of a biological attack, more casualties could be
suffered by other units downwind. Accordingly, a unit other than the targeted one may have priority for
support. The tables presented in the guide can be used in planning for either situation. Some tables show
estimated maximum numbers of personnel by illness severity category. Such estimates should be combined
with a comprehensive array of other available information to increase the effectiveness of medical force
planning.</p>

<h3>Section IV. MEDICAL PLANNING GUIDE FOR THE ESTIMATION OF
NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL BATTLE CASUALTIES
(CHEMICAL)&mdash;AMedP-8(A), VOLUME III</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_D-19" id="Para_D-19"></a>D-19. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The primary purpose of Volume III is to assist medical planners, logisticians, and staff officers
in predicting CW contingency requirements. Requirements include medical personnel, medical materiel
stockpiles, patient transport or evacuation capabilities, and facilities needed for patient decontamination,
triage, treatment, and supportive care. An optional purpose is to support medical operational
estimates.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The guide provides medical worst-case estimates of casualties and remaining operational
strength after a single CW attack on a tactically deployed, brigade-sized land force units, with protection
available and protection unavailable. These worst-case casually estimates are for personnel located within
both the targeted and the downwind hazard areas of the brigade. It is assumed that all targeted personnel
will be unsheltered and without medical pre-exposure prophylactic treatment. Tables in the guide are
designed to show total numbers of&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Casualties with different types and severities of injury at various times after exposure.</li>

<li>Personnel at different performance levels and times after exposure.</li>

<li>Fatalities at specified times after exposure.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-9" id="Page_D-9">[D-9]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The guide presents estimates of personnel status at specific time points. These range from 1 to 3
hours to 7 to 30 days after an attack, depending on the type of agent considered. Such estimates are
projected from all possible combinations of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seven operational scenarios involving three types of units: heavy brigade, support
brigade, and light infantry brigade.</li>

<li>Three chemical agents: the nerve agents GB and VX, and the blister agent HD.</li>

<li>Three types of munitions delivering the agents: aerial bombs, tactical ballistic missiles,
and rounds from multiple launch rocket systems/artillery batteries&mdash;</li>
</ul>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Three attack intensities for each type of munition: light, moderate, and heavy.</li>

<li>Two postures of individual physical protection against the attacks: unavailable and
available.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> An index to essential information and four sample problems to illustrate use of this information
are at the end of the guide (see Section 11). Section 11 provides a planning guide overview, describes
applications, and presents a brief explanation of modeling methods used to prepare estimates.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> The guide is subject to limitations of extent and content. Since there are many more possible
attack variables than those considered, the guide presents a limited number of estimates. These estimates
are based upon the best available toxicological values, but such values are qualified estimates. Therefore,
medical planners and staff personnel should use FM 8-9, NATO Handbook on the Medical Aspects of NBC
Defensive Operations, AMedP-6 (B), Part III&mdash;Chemical, for more authoritative medical descriptions and
information on effects of longer duration.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> The guide is most value to the user who needs to know what kinds of casualties to expect,
relative numbers of each, and the time frames in which they are likely to appear. To assist the user, who
lacks experience in actual CW, the guide describes types of injury, relevant factors, general magnitudes of
effects, and effects of time courses on chemical casualty numbers. The casualty estimates are appropriate
for training exercises. However, this initial attempt to provide complex estimates has limitations for
battlefield use. The limitations are described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The guide provides estimates for a few of many possible chemical attacks. Each estimate
is based upon computer modeling of the consequences of specified conditions. This is like saying that the
numbers of men who sneeze, after inhaling an allergic flower pollen, might be predicted if specific
information (EXAMPLE: The wind speed and direction, the current weather, altitude, time of day, and
sites of concentrated flower growth) is known for the specific geographic location of a particular brigade on
a given mountain. If such estimates are made for a few widely different mountains, a user of the estimates
may be able to guess the numbers of sneezing men in his own brigade, located on a separate mountain.
However, if the conditions on both mountains are not nearly identical, the user will need to estimate a
scaling factor and apply it to adjust the number predicted for a different environment.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-10" id="Page_D-10">[D-10]</a></span>
It is unlikely that exactly identical conditions will exist for any two mountains or chemical
attacks. The user of the guide must decide which scenario best represents his conditions (or interpolate
from two scenarios), then use or adjust the estimates. Therefore, each user must recognize any differences
from modeled conditions that might require him to increase, or decrease, an estimate. The user may need
to apply a commander's guidance on acceptable risk levels, or consider restrictions of available resources,
before accepting, interpreting, or modifying the relevant planning guide numbers. The most difficult
problem for the user will be to determine how much to increase, or decrease, planning guide numbers to fit
the user's situation. This problem is discussed in paragraph 3.4 of the guide.</li>

<li>The user should be aware that medical worst-case targeting selects for maximal numbers
of survivors entering the medical system, not for maximal operational losses. The tabulated estimates are
very highly sensitive to the degree of clustering of personnel and their assumed location within a standardized
brigade area. Accordingly, use of this targeting method leads to large variations that are based upon the
probabilities of hitting clustered personnel, not evenly or widely distributed personnel. Therefore, these
estimates do not provide a good basis for estimating the most likely outcomes for a series of "average"
attacks, or for comparing a scenario with an actual attack. Although the tabular format of the guide
suggests that the listed numbers are exact, the user should understand that different targeting could readily
produce other numbers. Selection of a scaling factor Is discussed in paragraph 3.4 of the guide.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_D-20" id="Para_D-20"></a>D-20. Medical Planning Considerations</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The guide provides medical planners and staff personnel with a systematic means for estimating
chemical casualties in various-sized units, without regard to composition. This document provides more
accurate and detailed estimates and is based upon detailed operational scenarios for brigade-sized units.
Both chemical planning guides support estimates of combat performance from individuals remaining in the
unit.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Effective mass casualty management requires careful planning. The guide is designed to
support such planning by providing medical planners and staff personnel with a systematic means for
estimating the number, type, and time-related status of chemical casualties.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Each user is advised to consult any available national military NBC
defense doctrinal publications of similar nature.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Medical requirements during CW may be substantially different from those for the usual
combat situation. There may be no indication of the presence of chemical agents in some tactical situations.
Unprotected units downwind from an attack area, or those entering contaminated areas in an unprotected
posture, may be unexpectedly exposed to chemical agents. However, casualty management also involves
practice of self-aid and buddy aid, on-site medical triage and emergency care, transport to medical facilities,
communications, health services, logistics, and evacuation by ground or air transportation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-11" id="Page_D-11">[D-11]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> The signs and symptoms of chemical agent exposure may be sudden and intense, or delayed
and subtle, depending on the agent used and the level of exposure. Individuals may not reach the first level
of care for 15 to 60 minutes after the onset of effects. Decontamination may delay medical treatment.
Stabilization should occur before casualties leave emergency care areas, but contamination of these areas
may delay the stabilization process. However, effects of decontamination or secondary contamination on
estimated doses and effects are not considered in the guide. For medical planning, users of the guide need
to consider the various qualifications of its casualty estimates, as discussed in paragraphs 3.4 and 3.4.2 of
the guide.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> A chemical burn caused by HD can require more care than a same-sized burn induced by
conventional munitions. Therefore, the initial prognosis may require revision after treatment is underway,
and estimates of percent capable by performance band may require adjustment.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-21" id="Para_D-21"></a>D-21. Triage</h4>

<p class="noindent">Since a chemical attack may produce mass casualties, preparations for a triage system should be in place
before the attack. Paragraph 2.5.1 of the guide describes patient categories by injury severity. For a
particular described operational scenario, this information may be used to estimate the number of patients
with specified levels of injury. The guide does not provide estimates of the number of patients by triage
classification or usual medical and toxicological descriptions.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-22" id="Para_D-22"></a>D-22. Evacuation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> An efficient and flexible evacuation plan is essential for adequate casualty treatment and to
retain mobility of forward medical resources. For assessment of a potential mass casualty situation, the full
range of evacuation assets, limitations, and obstacles should be considered by the medical planner. After an
attack, the medical staff may need to estimate the number of casualties that require evacuation resources at
given postexposure times.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Evacuation requirements will vary with the type of chemical agent used. Nerve agent casualties
may not be evacuated because the time course of severe effects is relatively short. Depending upon
exposure conditions, HD casualties may or may not require evacuation to a facility where they can receive
care for several days, or possibly 6 to 9 months. Estimates provided in the guide can be used as a starting
point from which to plan for evacuation resources.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-23" id="Para_D-23"></a>D-23. In-Unit Care</h4>

<p class="noindent">The casualty estimates in the guide are presented with no allowance for in-unit care such as self-aid or
buddy aid. Soldiers trained in first aid procedures may be the first to see chemical injuries. The guide can
provide an estimate of the numbers of injured personnel who will require first aid. However, there may be
need for rapid augmentation, support, or other intervention. Delays in obtaining medical care may occur
because of physical damage or contamination of the surrounding area. The tables described in paragraphs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-12" id="Page_D-12">[D-12]</a></span>
3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of the guide give the time courses of effects that may apply to estimation of in-unit and
delayed medical requirements.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-24" id="Para_D-24"></a>D-24. Patient Bed Requirements</h4>

<p class="noindent">Requirements for patient beds and hospitalization time may be greater after chemical exposures than after a
conventional attack. Such increases are particularly important for agents, such as HD, that produce injuries
followed by a long recovery period. Bed requirements can be estimated using the tables described in
paragraphs 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 of the guide. Casualties Occurring by Time Period tables (see paragraph 3.3.3)
in the guide are useful after an attack since they show gains and losses of casualties over time. Personnel by
Injury Category tables (as described in paragraph 3.3.4) in the guide may be more useful in long-range
planning. They show maximum numbers of personnel by injury severity category. The tables in the guide
only provide estimates for the first 30 days after attack. Depending upon the theater evacuation policy
specified for the operation, hospital days may be either in theater or in the national area.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-25" id="Para_D-25"></a>D-25. Medical Logistics</h4>

<p class="noindent">The estimates provided in the guide are intended to support projections of medical materiel and logistical
requirements. Increased demands may occur for certain types of medical and general supplies. These may
include specific equipment, kits, dressings, antibiotics, and other critical medical materiel. Demands may
also increase for items unique to the chemical battlefield (such as nerve agent antidote autoinjectors), as well
as items adapted to chemical environments (including IV systems and special self-contained intensive care
units). Tables showing maximum numbers of personnel by injury severity category (see paragraph 3.3.4 in
the guide) can provide useful input for logistical planning.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_D-26" id="Para_D-26"></a>D-26. Medical Force Planning</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The assignment of medical support is normally based upon the total military population and
the expected conventional casualty rate. The guide may be used to assess requirements for additional
medical units. The use of chemical weapons in tactical situations could be one indication of an increased
tempo of warfare and need for additional personnel.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Although a unit may be targeted for chemical attack, that unit might not be located where the
highest number of casualties could occur (as in a downwind hazard area). Accordingly, another unit might
have priority for support. The tables presented in the guide can be used in planning for either situation.
Some tables (see paragraph 3.3.4 in the guide) show estimated maximum numbers of personnel by injury
severity category. Such estimates should be combined with a comprehensive array of other available
information to increase the effectiveness of medical force planning.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The guide is organized into 11 sections. Section 1 introduces the guide and presents
background and medical planning considerations. Section 2 provides information on the methodology used
to develop the estimates of fatalities, casualties, and effectiveness of individuals remaining in the unit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_D-13" id="Page_D-13">[D-13]</a></span>
Section 3 explores the use of the casualty prediction tables based on combat effectiveness decrements and
estimates of the number of casualties categorized by insult level. Sections 4 through 10 contain tables of
casualty estimates. Section 11 is a tutorial on use of the tool.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> These medical worst-case casualty estimates (see paragraph 2.1.2 through 2.1.7 in the guide)
are for personnel in the chemical-targeted and downwind hazard areas of the brigade sector. The actual
areas presenting chemical agent hazards to personnel are relatively small and localized when compared to
the entire brigade sector. These estimates are not valid for acute effects from repeated exposures, possible
delayed effects of low dosage exposures, operational worst-case targeting, targets with different numbers or
distributions of exposed personnel, or attacks involving different conditions (of meteorology, terrain,
protective status, and so forth) than are modeled. Although the guide is primarily designed to support
medical force planning for future CW defense, it may be used to anticipate short-term requirements. For
example, delayed requirements of HD victims for care or evacuation resources may be predicted from
tables that give estimates of casually numbers by injury type at given times after a CW attack (see
paragraphs 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 in the guide).</p>

EMPLOYMENT OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL COLLECTIVE
PROTECTION SHELTER SYSTEMS BY MEDICAL UNITS</h2>


<h3>Section I. INTRODUCTION</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_F-1" id="Para_F-1"></a>F-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">To continue the HSS mission under CB conditions, MTFs must search out contamination free areas or
employ CPS systems. Levels I and II MTFs may be able to locate contamination free areas; however, due
to the mobility limitations of hospitals, they must always be prepared to operate under CB conditions if the
area is under attack. Systems that can be employed as an MTF (Levels I, II, III, and IV) are described in
this appendix.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_F-2" id="Para_F-2"></a>F-2. Types of Collective Protection Shelter Systems</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The CBPS system is employed at the BAS, DCS, and FST. The CBPS is attached to the hard-walled
box on the rear of a high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV). The BAS will have
one CBPS system per treatment team; the DCS will have four CBPS systems; the FST will have three CBPS
systems. Also, systems will be issued to other selected medical treatment teams. When employed at the
DCS, the patient holding team will also require GP tents to hold their required number of patients (see
<a href="#CHAPTER_4">Chapter 4</a>). Patients held inside the CBPS will be those that have been decontaminated and admitted into the
system for treatment and are recovering from the treatment procedures and are awaiting evacuation. Any
patients held in the GP tent must remain in MOPP Level 4 (the GP tent will not have collective protection);
these patients are those that are expected to RTD within 72 hours.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTES</p>

<p class="noindent">1. Normally, patients will not be held at the DCS under NBC
conditions unless evacuation cannot be accomplished. They should be
RTD or evacuated to a clean MTF, as soon as the mission permits.</p>

<p class="noindent">2. The CBPS can also be employed as the DCS in the conventional
mode. Employment in either mode still requires GP tentage for patient
holding to meet total patient holding requirements.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The DEPMEDS-equipped patient care areas of the US Army Force XXI hospital and the
hospital unit base (HUB) of the Medical Force 2000 (MF2K) will employ the CP DEPMEDS. It will not
protect personnel or patients from the thermal, blast, and initial radiation effects of nuclear weapons; however,
it will provide some protection against fallout effects. Areas of the hospital that are not included in the
chemically protected (CP) DEPMEDS are MF2K general hospital unit medical (HUM), MF2K field hospital
unit holding (HUH), MF2K combat support and general hospital unit surgical (HUS), minimum care wards,
administrative areas, food service, supply (including Class VIII), and staff quarters. The system includes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-2" id="Page_F-2">[F-2]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Chemically/biologically protected liners for tent, expandable, modular, personnel
(TEMPER) and passageways.</li>

<li>CB-filtered and conditioned (heated or cooled) air (field deployable environmental control
unit [FDECU] or H80 Army Standard Heater).</li>

<li>Chemically/biologically protected ambulatory, litter, and supply air locks.</li>

<li>Chemically/biologically protected latrines.</li>

<li>Chemically/biologically protected seals for ISO shelters.</li>

<li>Chemically/biologically protected water supply system.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The M20 simplified collective protection system is another system that is available. It consists
of a chemically protected room liner, a CB filter blower, and an ambulatory air lock. However, it does not
have a litter air lock making it unsuitable for litter patient care. The M20 may be used to protect medical
staffs at the DCS, FST, and hospitals, patients held in the GP tents at the DCS and in the minimum care
wards and staff quarters of the hospitals. Thus providing additional CB protection for staffs and patients.</p>


<h3>Section II. EMPLOYMENT OF THE CHEMICALLY BIOLOGICALLY
PROTECTED SHELTER SYSTEM</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_F-3" id="Para_F-3"></a>F-3. Establish a Battalion Aid Station in a Chemically Biologically Protected Shelter</h4>

<p class="noindent">To establish a BAS in a CBPS, use one CBPS per treatment team for conventional operations in a split-team
mode. When operating in a squad configuration and in the conventional mode, the two CBPS systems may
be complexed to provide more workspace. However, keep in mind that the treatment squad is not staffed to
operate the two systems in the CB mode. Therefore, when the two systems are complexed and the
treatment squad must convert and operate in the CB mode, they may want to close the complexing door and
only use one system. When initially setting up the CBPS for operations in the CB mode, only one CBPS is
setup; see <a href="#NOT_F-3">Note 2</a> below. Set up the system as described in TM 10-5410-228-10. To be operational as a
BAS, set up medical supplies and equipment as required or as designated in the TSOP. A PDS consisting of
a contaminated ambulance point, contaminated triage point, a patient decontamination area, and a
contaminated treatment area is established on the downwind (prevailing wind) side of the CBPS. An
overhead cover of plastic sheeting (approximately 20 feet wide by 50 feet long) is set up over the PDS, the
hot line, and the clean treatment/waiting area; the cover overlaps the air locks. The clean treatment/waiting
area should have an area at least 20 feet wide by 15 feet long to allow space for placing patients into the
litter air lock without crossing the hot line. A second area covered with 20 × 25 feet of plastic sheeting (the
evacuation holding area) is set up beside the shelter on the opposite side from the generator. The clean
treatment area is separated from the decontamination area by a hot line with a shuffle pit. Only clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-3" id="Page_F-3">[F-3]</a></span>
(decontaminated) patients or personnel are allowed to cross the hot line into the clean treatment area, or are
admitted into the CBPS. <a href="#FIG_F-1">Figure F-1</a> presents one layout of a BAS using the CBPS. See TM 10-5410-228-10
for complete details on setting up, operating, and maintaining the CBPS. Each CBPS provides 300 square
feet of work area.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold"><a name="NOT_F-3" id="NOT_F-3"></a>NOTES</p>

<p class="noindent">1. The overhead cover is not needed when the wind speed exceeds
10 knots per hour. The plastic will not stay in place.</p>

<p class="noindent">2. Although each treatment team of the BAS has a CBPS; only one
system is set up when operating in the CB mode. This is due to the
lack of authorized personnel to operate all systems at one time in the
CB mode. <b>Eight medical</b> personnel are required to operate the BAS
(employing one CBPS) in the CB mode. At least eight nonmedical
personnel are required to perform patient decontamination <b>under
medical supervision</b>. Also, only setting up one system in the CB
mode provides the BAS the ability to retain its flexibility in order to
maintain its support mission of being where it is needed and when it is
needed. The CBPS can be used as the treatment shelter in the
conventional mode as well. When the treatment squad is operating in
the split-team mode, each team will have a CBPS for use as its
treatment shelter. When operating one system in the CB mode, the
other system provides a replacement in the event the one in use in the
CB mode is damaged beyond repair. This ensures continued HSS to
the command.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_F-4" id="Para_F-4"></a>F-4. Division Clearing Station in a Chemically Biologically Protected Shelter</h4>

<p class="noindent">To establish a DCS using the CBPS, set up four shelters as described in the TM. To be operational, medical
supplies and equipment are set up as outlined in the unit TSOP. The four shelters are complexed as shown
in <a href="#FIG_F-2">Figure F-2</a>. With four CBPS systems set up and operational, a total of 1,200 square feet of work area is
available. The contaminated triage, decontamination, and contaminated treatment areas are separated from
the clean treatment/waiting area by a hot line with a shuffle pit. Overhead covering is provided as described
for the BAS. Patients are admitted through the EMT litter or ambulatory air lock. Patients are released
through the patient holding air locks. This aids in controlling entry and exits; thus preventing the introduction
of contamination into the systems. At least eight nonmedical personnel from supported units are required to
perform patient decontamination under medical supervision at the DCS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-5" id="Page_F-5">[F-5]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">In the event that the overpressure system fails on a system that is in
use with entry/exit air locks, move to the available shelter with an
entry/exit air lock in the same direction for use as the entry/exit until
the failed system can be restored. Example 1: At the DCS the EMT
system fails, move to the ATM shelter to receive patients until the
EMT system has been restored. Example 2: At the DCS the patient
hold system fails, move exits to the dental/lab/x-ray shelter until the
patient hold system can be restored. Example 3: At the FST the
postoperative system fails, use the preoperative shelter until the
postoperative system can be restored. These options will allow patient
care operations to continue until the failed systems can be restored.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_F-5" id="Para_F-5"></a>F-5. Forward Surgical Team in a Chemically Biologically Protected Shelter</h4>

<p class="noindent">To establish a FST using the CBPSs, follow the procedures for the DCS except set up three CBPSs. All
equipment is set up inside the CBPS as required by your unit TSOP. With three CBPSs set up and
operational, a total of 900 square feet of work area is available (<a href="#FIG_F-3">Figure F-3</a>). When the FST is forward in
support of a medical company and operating in the CB mode, the FST systems are connected to the DCS of
the supported medical company. <a href="#FIG_F-4">Figure F-4</a> shows the FST and DCS connected. When operating in the
CB mode with the medical company, all patients are received through the EMT air lock of the DCS. The
patients are triaged in the DCS and, based upon their injuries, they are routed to the DCS treatment area or
to the FST for surgical care. Patients released from the FST for evacuation are placed in a PPW and
processed through the litter air lock in the FST recovery section. Patient decontamination is performed at
the PDS operated by the DCS. The FST cannot operate in a CB environment without being complexed with
the DCS. They do not have any patient decontamination capabilities.</p>

<h3>Section III. EMPLOYMENT OF THE CHEMICALLY PROTECTED
DEPLOYABLE MEDICAL SYSTEMS AND SIMPLIFIED COLLECTIVE
PROTECTION SYSTEMS</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_F-6" id="Para_F-6"></a>F-6. Collective Protection in a Deployable Medical System-Equipped Hospital</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> When the threat of NBC action is anticipated in the AO, the CP DEPMEDS components must
be set up as the hospital is being established. The system cannot be set up in a hospital that has already been
established; to do so requires the hospital to be closed, all TEMPERs be struck, and erected with the M28
liners installed during the erection process. To establish CPS in a DEPMEDS-equipped hospital, follow the
procedures as described in TM 10-5410-283-14&amp;P. Training Circular 8-13 provides instructions on
establishing a US Army DEPMEDS-equipped hospital (without CPS). <a href="#FIG_F-5">Figure F-5</a> presents one layout of
the DEPMEDS-equipped patient care area of a MF2K CSH HUB employing the CP DEPMEDS with an
internal water supply system. <a href="#FIG_F-6">Figure F-6</a> presents a layout of the patient care area of the DEPMEDS-equipped
portion of an 84-bed MRI hospital. <a href="#FIG_F-7">Figure F-7</a> presents a layout of the patient care area of the
DEPMEDS-equipped portion of a 164-bed MRI hospital.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> When employing CP DEPMEDS, provisions for waste disposal and protected water and food
supplies within the system are established. Additionally, Class VIII supplies must be protected from
contamination. Supplies not in use or needed in the protected operational areas are stored in medical chests,
shipping containers, or wrapped in layers of plastic that are inside covered areas, such as closed MILVANs
or tents. When contamination is present, only open these storage areas for operational area emergency
resupply. Use plastic sheeting or other leak-proof material to provide an additional barrier between the
supplies and the contamination. Wrap supplies in plastic or other barrier material for movement from the
storage area to the resupply air lock of the CP DEPMEDS.</p>

<ul>
<li>A water supply system with distribution hoses is established inside the CP DEPMEDS
areas (<a href="#FIG_F-5">Figure F-5</a>). Pumps continuously circulate the water from the storage tank through the hose system
back to the storage tank. The continuous circulation ensures that the chlorine residual is maintained in the
water supply. Personnel in areas that are not included in the continuous flow system must draw water from
the system and carry it to their work areas in 5-gallon water cans or other containers. Water resupply is
accomplished by passing a hose through the utility port at the end of the TEMPER and M28 liner for a
connection to the water transport vehicle. The ends of both hoses must be decontaminated with a 5 percent
chlorine solution before connecting them together. The vehicle must have a tank or water supply container
that is NBC protected to ensure that the water supplied is free of NBC contamination.</li>

<li>Rations, as determined by the hospital commander, should be available within the
protected area for personnel and patients. Under emergency conditions the commander can authorize
feeding patients MRE rations for limited periods of time (up to 72 hours), if they are able to chew and
swallow. However, attempts must be made to ensure the required types of rations for patient feeding are
available in the CPS. The rations can be stored in any available space; however, the rations must be
protected from exposure to possible contaminants, especially liquids. Ration control measures are established
to ensure that the rations are only consumed as provided for in the hospital TSOP.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-9" id="Page_F-9">[F-9]</a></span>
Two CB protected latrine systems are included in the CP DEPMEDS. The latrines
contain bedpan wash areas. The waste from the latrines is collected in an outside receiving container. The
waste is removed from the container and disposed of as outlined in the unit TSOP.</li>

<li>Solid waste (including medical) must be placed in plastic bags. Seal the top of the bags to
prevent spillage, odors, or spread of infections/disease. NEVER overfill the bags; always leave enough room
in the bag to make a good seal. Place the sealed bags in the supply air lock. Inside personnel close the inner
door to the air lock. Outside personnel check to ensure that the inner air lock door is closed before opening the
outside door. Remove the bags and take them to the designated waste collection/disposal site. Disposal may
be by burial on site or by transport to a designated disposal facility. Transport may be by organic vehicles or
contractor support vehicles. The specific technique for disposal will be outlined in the unit TSOP.</li>

<li>All liquid waste produced within the CP DEPMEDS is collected through a piped liquid
waste system to a central collection container. The waste container for the latrines may be used to collect
the liquid waste from the operational areas of the CP DEPMEDS. The container is emptied and the waste
disposed of as outlined in the unit TSOP.</li>

<h4><a name="Para_F-7" id="Para_F-7"></a>F-7. Chemically/Biologically Protecting the International Organization for Standardization Shelter</h4>

<p class="noindent">To chemically/biologically protect the ISO shelters, seal all seams and openings of the ISO to prevent the
entry of CB agents. The seals connecting the various sides and floor of the shelter may be a CB protected
material; thus providing a seal to the shelter. When the seals are not of a CB protected material, the seams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-12" id="Page_F-12">[F-12]</a></span>
must be taped to provide a CB protected barrier over the soft seals. Any openings not being used for
introduction of support power lines, water lines or waste water lines must be sealed to prevent entry of CB
agents. All access panels must be securely closed to prevent entry of vapors.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_F-8" id="Para_F-8"></a>F-8. Chemically/Biologically Protecting the Vestibules</h4>

<p class="noindent">The vestibules connect TEMPERs to TEMPERs, ISOs to ISOs, and ISOs and TEMPERs. To harden the
vestibules, install the CB liners inside and fasten the ends to the liners of the TEMPER or to the doors of the
ISOs. Vestibule liner connectors are provided for use at the entry of each ISO.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_F-9" id="Para_F-9"></a>F-9. Chemically/Biologically Protecting Air Handler Equipment</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> The FDECU is chemically/biologically protected. The system can be operated without the CB
filters. When required to operate in the CB mode, the fresh air intake on the FDECU is closed and the CB
filter blower is turned on drawing fresh air through the filters to support the FDECU and to provide clean
air for the CPS. Additionally, recirculation filters are placed within the shelter system to remove any agent
that may have entered through any of the entry/exit areas or through breaches in the shelter system.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> When heaters are required, they must be chemically/biologically protected to prevent entry of
contamination. The CB filter units are connected to the fresh air intake side of the heater and the heated air
discharge side of the heater is connected to the air supply of the TEMPER/ISO.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_F-10" id="Para_F-10"></a>F-10. Establish Collective Protection Shelter Using the M20 Simplified Collective Protection System</h4>

<p class="noindent">The M20 is used to establish a CPS within a room of opportunity, or inside a tent; however, the available
space will be limited by tent poles and other components of the tent. Currently this system only provides
ambient temperature air. See the TM and manufacturer's publication provided with the system and system
components for details.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The M20 does not have a litter air lock. Only staff or ambulatory
patients can enter. See the TM provided with the system for setup
procedures.</p>
<br />
</div>


<h4><a name="Para_F-11" id="Para_F-11"></a>F-11. Casualty Decontamination</h4>

<p class="noindent">Patients admitted into the MTF must be contamination free. Therefore, a casualty decontamination area
must be established near the MTF. The casualty decontamination area should be provided with an overhead
cover as described for the CBPS system, except that it does not overlap the entry to the hospital. Also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-13" id="Page_F-13">[F-13]</a></span>
consideration must be given to the location of other operations at the hospital site when establishing the
casualty decontamination area. However, the area must be close enough to the entry/exit of the CPS to
protect the patients from the environment and reduce their exposure to recontamination. Keep in mind that
under NBC conditions personnel outside of the CPS are at MOPP Level 4 (except decontaminated patients;
they have their mask on), thus increasing the stress load and reducing their overall performance capabilities.
The entry/exit area must have overhead cover to protect patients awaiting access to the CPS. See <a href="#APP_I">Appendix I</a>
for setting up a casualty decontamination area and for decontamination procedures.</p>


<h3>Section IV. OPERATIONS, ENTRY, AND EXIT GUIDELINES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_F-12" id="Para_F-12"></a>F-12. Operations</h4>

<p class="noindent">These operations, entry, and exit guidelines may be used to prepare a unit SOP for the operation of CPS
systems in your unit.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> When using these guidelines, the following should be considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Location of the shelter (flat, hilly, rocky ground).</li>

<li>General climate of the AO (high and low temperature variations during operation).</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Information on setting up, striking, and operating the CPS is contained in the equipment
publications. Where applicable, special procedures are provided in these publications for setting up in both
clean and CB vapor hazard areas. However, the CP DEPMEDS is NOT set up in a CB vapor hazard area.
The commander will determine which procedures to use.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> During operations, periodic checks are made of the atmosphere within the shelter. These
checks are made by using available chemical agent detection equipment and material to determine if
chemical agent penetration has occurred. Should chemical agent penetration occur, all personnel must
mask; then ensure that patients are protected until the agent has been purged from the shelter.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_F-13" id="Para_F-13"></a>F-13. Decontamination of Entrance Area</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Normally, the MTF will not operate in a CB vapor hazard environment. However, if the
MTF must remain in an area on a temporary basis and liquid agent contamination is present, the immediate
area around the entrance must be decontaminated.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> To decontaminate the area around the entrance, use one or more of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn over about 2 inches of soil.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_F-14" id="Page_F-14">[F-14]</a></span>
Remove the top 1-inch layer of soil containing the liquid agent. Use the CAM or M8
detector paper to check the area after the topsoil is removed to ensure complete agent removal.</li>

<li>Add several inches of clean soil or sand.</li>

<li>Mix STB into the top 1/2 to 1 inch of soil.</li>

<li>Use DS2 on contaminated hard-surfaced areas or frozen ground.</li>
</ul>


<h4><a name="Para_F-14" id="Para_F-14"></a>F-14. Procedures Prior to Entry</h4>

<p class="noindent">All personnel (staff and patients) must be decontaminated before they are permitted entry into the CPS.</p>

<ul class="pad1">
<li>Use chemical detection equipment to check for the presence of contamination on individuals
and their equipment; also check for presence of contamination on individual weapons if they are allowed in
the CPS. Normally, weapons will not be allowed in the patient care areas, but will be stored outside near
the entry/exit. Thorough decontamination is critical in preventing contamination transfer into the CPS.</li>

<li>When a chemical agent is detected, follow the procedures in <a href="#APP_C">Appendix C</a> for patient
decontamination and FM 3-5 for other personnel decontamination before entering the CPS. All contaminated
clothing and equipment are placed in the contaminated dump. Weapons should not have been evacuated
with patients. However, if weapons are evacuated with the patient, they are decontaminated and held by the
MTF (administrative personnel or hospital supply) for disposition instructions.</li>

<li>Decontamination must be thorough; procedures must be strictly followed. Failure to do so can
contaminate the interior of the MTF and injure medical treatment personnel; thus reducing their mission
support capabilities.</li>
</ul>


<p class="p2" />

opens the inner door and checks the patient to ensure that he is contamination free. The patient is checked
by placing the CAM nozzle near absorptive surfaces, such as the patient's hair. If no contamination is
found, the aidman removes the patient's mask and places it in a plastic bag. The inside aidmen remove the
patient from the air lock and position him on treatment litter stands, or move him to the treatment area as
directed by supervisory personnel.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Patients received at the treatment facility in the PPW are checked for contamination;
if they are contamination free, they may be processed through the litter air lock in the PPW. The inside
aidmen ensure that the inner litter air lock door is closed. The outside aidmen open the outer air lock door
and place the litter on the litter rails and push the patient into the litter air lock headfirst, then close the outer
door. Purge the air lock for 3 minutes. After the purge time, an aidman inside of the CPS opens the inner
air lock door and uses the CAM to check the patient to ensure that he is free of contamination. If no
contamination is found, the inside aidmen remove the patient from the air lock. (If the patient is wearing a
protective mask, the mask is removed and placed in a plastic bag before the patient is moved from the air
lock.) As the patient is removed from the air lock, the PPW is opened and rolled inside out so that any
desorbing vapors are adsorbed by the charcoal layer. The inside aidmen remove the patient from the air lock
and position him on litter stands. The patient is transferred to a clean litter; then moved to the treatment area
as directed by supervisory personnel. The receiving litter and PPW is returned to the outside; dispose of the
PPW in the contaminated waste dump. Decontaminate the litter and return it to the litter pool.</p>

<h2><span class="ch"><a name="APP_G" id="APP_G"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">APPENDIX G</a></span><br /><br />

PATIENT DECONTAMINATION</h2>


<h3>Section I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4><a name="Para_G-1" id="Para_G-1"></a>G-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Patient decontamination presents special problems for units and HSS personnel. Nuclear,
biological, and chemical contaminated patients create increased hazards to rescuers and HSS personnel;
thus, causing delays in providing essential first aid and medical treatment for injuries from sources other
than the exposure to NBC weapons/agents. Casualty decontamination procedures are performed by each
individual, as buddy aid, or at a unit decontamination station prior to the arrival of medical personnel. See
FM 3-5 for procedures on individual, buddy aid, and unit decontamination. Patient decontamination
procedures are normally performed at an MTF under medical supervision. Patient decontamination stations
may be established (collocated) at central unit decontamination faculties, if medical support is available.
However, augmentation medical support must be requested to provide patient care and supervise the patient
decontamination process. Because, when the unit is undergoing decontamination operations, organic
medical personnel must also decontaminate their equipment and personnel. Therefore, they are not available
to provide medical support for operating the patient decontamination station that is collocated with the
central unit decontamination facility.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> The term "decontamination" as used herein means the removal or neutralization of radioactive
particles, BW agents, and CW agents to levels low enough that patients may be treated without contaminating
the MTF and without posing health risks to unprotected medical providers. "Decontamination" does not
imply absolute removal of contaminants.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">The decontamination procedures described below are for NBC
contaminated patients. These procedures may also be used for most
TIM contaminated patients. However, soap and water will suffice for
most TIMs; but some TIMs react with water. For those TIMs another
material must be used to decontaminate patients. For detailed
information on decontamination of TIM contaminated patients, see
FM 8-500.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Physical removal of contaminants is the primary method of decontamination. Physical removal
does not require vigorous scrubbing; in fact, vigorous scrubbing can force some agents deeper into the skin;
thus, increasing the agent effect rather than reducing its effects. The use of a M291 skin decontaminating
kit (SDK) neutralizes/reduces the effects of an agent, but physical removal is of utmost importance. When a
SDK is not available, the use of soap and water should be considered as the next best method. However,
the use of soap and water requires large amounts of water that may not be available because the soap must
be rinsed from the skin to reduce skin irritation from the soap. An alternate skin decontaminant is a
hypochlorite solution; but it should only be used when SDKs and/or sufficient quantities of water are not
available. Use a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution on the protective mask and skin. A 5 percent hypochlorite
solution can be used on the mask hood, gloves, and other outer garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-2" id="Page_G-2">[G-2]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">CAUTION</p>

<p class="noindent">Do not use the 5 percent solution on the skin; it can cause
severe skin irritation.</p>
</div>


<h4><a name="Para_G-2" id="Para_G-2"></a>G-2. Immediate Decontamination</h4>

<p class="noindent">Decontamination must begin at the platoon and company level with the individual soldier, prior to the
arrival of medical personnel. The soldier himself or members of his team must perform immediate
decontamination. When the casualty's condition and the mission permits, they may go through a MOPP
gear exchange at their unit before evacuation (see FM 3-5). Performing a MOPP gear exchange at the unit
before evacuation will reduce the amount of contamination that can be transferred to the MEDEVAC
vehicle. However, the MOPP gear exchange must not cause further injury to the casualty. First aid for
CW agent must be administered; such as administering nerve agent antidotes (such as nerve agent antidotes
and convulsant antidote for nerve agent [CANA]), as required. Enter the time and type of contamination on
a field expedient NBC casualty card (<a href="#FIG_G-1">Figure G-1</a>). Use the CAM, M8 chemical agent detector paper, or
M9 tape to determine the type of chemical contamination. Use a radiation detection meter/device to
determine the level of radioactive contamination, if required. Currently, there are no BW agent detectors
that can be used to check patients for BW agent contamination. Therefore, all patients suspected of being
contaminated with a BW agent must be decontaminated. When medical personnel arrive, they should enter
the time and type of contamination and number of antidote injections that were administered as first aid on
the Department of Defense (DD) Form 1380 (Field Medical Card [FMC]).</p>

<h4><a name="Para_G-3" id="Para_G-3"></a>G-3. Patient Decontamination and Thorough Decontamination Collocation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Collocating patient and thorough decontamination operations in the BSA may provide several
advantages (<a href="#FIG_G-2">Figure G-2</a>). It&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-3" id="Page_G-3">[G-3]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>Preserves the principle of limiting the spread of contamination.</li>

<li>Reduces confusion on the battlefield.</li>

<li>Reduces demand on logistics support elements.</li>

<li>Improves contamination control and reporting: One location and one person in charge.</li>

<li>Reduces overall security requirements.</li>

<li>Speeds PDS closure by using the thorough decontamination site.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> An identified disadvantage is the increased size of the site and the requirement for medical
support augmentation (a treatment squad from another organization with required patient decontamination
and treatment MESs) to operate the PDS.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Organic medical personnel must not be used to perform the HSS
mission at the collocated site. They must go through the
decontamination process with their unit.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> These operations do not require that both patient decontamination and unit thorough
decontamination be executed simultaneously. The PDS can be running while the thorough decontamination
site is being prepared. Patient decontamination cannot be delayed since patients may be suffering life-threatening
injuries as well as exposure to NBC agents. Therefore, the PDS must be established and
operational before the first patients arrive. The wind direction must be common to both sites.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> The decontamination platoon leader is responsible for establishing the combined
decontamination site. The medical unit commander/surgeon coordinates with the decontamination platoon
leader for the location of the patient receiving, PDS, and MTF. The lowest level at which this operation
will usually be planned is brigade. This operation requires extensive planning and must involve the brigade
chemical officer, brigade S4, and the medical company commander/brigade surgeon. Decontamination
support for special operation forces, other unique operational organizations, or for nonlinear operations
may require execution at a lower level. The supporting medical personnel operate the PDS. Nonmedical
personnel perform patient decontamination procedures under medical supervision. Patient decontamination
procedures are described below.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Patient decontamination differs from thorough decontamination in that
the patients' medical status must be monitored and medical treatment
must be provided during the decontamination process.</p>
<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-4" id="Page_G-4">[G-4]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Although a PDS may be collocated with thorough decontamination, a PDS must be operational
at Levels I, II, III, and IV MTFs. Contaminated patients may present directly to the MTF for care, or
patients previously decontaminated may become contaminated en route. Therefore, all patients arriving at
an MTF must be checked for contamination. If contaminated, they must be decontaminated before they are
admitted to the MTF.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_G-4" id="Para_G-4"></a>G-4. Patient Decontamination at the Battalion Aid Station (Level I)</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> When battle conditions prevent patient decontamination procedures forward or the patient is
contaminated en route, the patient may have to be decontaminated at the BAS. Contaminated patients
arriving at the BAS must be decontaminated before admission into the clean treatment area.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Patient decontamination is performed by eight nonmedical personnel from the supported unit
at the BAS. The patient decontamination personnel operate as two-man teams to perform the patient
decontamination procedures. The patient decontamination teams operate under the supervision of medical
personnel to ensure that no further injury is caused to the patient by the decontamination process. Each
team receives a patient from the triage point and performs both clothing removal and skin decontamination
procedures. The team requires assistance from another team to perform litter changes; see details below.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_G-5" id="Para_G-5"></a>G-5. Patient Decontamination at the Medical Company Clearing Station (Level II)</h4>

<p class="noindent">The medical company clearing station may receive patients from the BAS or directly from other areas who
have not been decontaminated. The clearing station must also have a patient decontamination area. As with
the BAS, the clearing station must have a minimum of eight nonmedical personnel from the supported units
to perform patient decontamination. Procedures for patient decontamination at the clearing station are the
same as for the BAS.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_G-6" id="Para_G-6"></a>G-6. Patient Decontamination at a Hospital (Level III or IV)</h4>

<p class="noindent">To the maximum extent possible, hospitals are located away from tactical or logistical targets. Contaminated
patients will arrive from forward MTFs and units located within the geographical area of the hospital.
Patient decontamination is done by at least 20 nonmedical personnel from units located in the geographical
area/base cluster of the hospital. Procedures for patient decontamination at the hospital are the same as for
the BAS. However, several patient decontamination stations can be operated simultaneously at the hospital
patient decontamination site. Further, all patients arriving at the hospital will be decontaminated and
receive full treatment within the capabilities of the hospital.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_G-7" id="Para_G-7"></a>G-7. Prepare Hypochlorite Solutions for Patient Decontamination</h4>

<p class="noindent">An alternative patient decontamination agent is a hypochlorite solution; however, the hypochlorite solution
must be prepared. Two concentrations of the hypochlorite solution are required. A 5 percent hypochlorite
solution to decontaminate gloves, aprons, litters, cutting devices, the patient's mask hood, and other
nonskin contact areas. The patient's mask, skin, splints, and tourniquets and their wounds are irrigated
using a 0.5 (½) percent hypochlorite solution. To prepare the solutions, use calcium hypochlorite (HTH)
granules (supplied in 6-ounce jars in the chemical agent patient treatment and chemical agent patient
decontamination MES), bulk HTH, or sodium hypochlorite (household bleach). Prepare the required
solutions as shown in Table G-1 below.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_G-8" id="Para_G-8"></a>G-8. Classification of Patients</h4>

<p class="noindent">On the NBC battlefield, two classifications of patients will be encountered&mdash;contaminated and
uncontaminated. Those contaminated may suffer from the effects of an NBC agent, of a conventional
wound, or both. Some may suffer combat stress or heat injuries induced by the stress of NBC conditions
and extended time spent in MOPP Level 4. It is important to follow proper decontamination procedures to
limit the spread of contamination to others and equipment. The most important decontamination is performed
at the site of contamination. Decontamination at a later time may be too late to prevent injury to the
individual, especially when exposed to vesicants. All agents should be promptly removed from the skin.</p>

<h3>Section II. PATIENT DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES</h3>


<h4><a name="Para_G-10" id="Para_G-10"></a>G-10. Decontaminate a Litter Chemical Agent Patient</h4>

<p class="noindent">Before contaminated patients receive medical treatment in the clean treatment area, they must be
decontaminated. Place the cutting device in a container of 5 percent hypochlorite solution between each
use. Each decontamination team member decontaminates his gloves and apron with the 5 percent
hypochlorite solution frequently to prevent spreading any contamination to patient's skin. Decontaminate
the patient's skin, bandages, wounds, mask, identification tags with chain, and splints with a 0.5 percent
hypochlorite solution. The litter patient is decontaminated and undressed as follows:</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Litter patients requiring EMT or ATM in the clean area of the MTF
will be completely decontaminated. A patient not requiring clean
EMT or ATM at the MTF, but requiring further evacuation (for
example: a stable patient with a partial amputation of a lower
extremity) should only have his wound area and MOPP spot
decontaminated to remove any gross contamination. The patient
should be evacuated in his MOPP.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> <b>Step 1. Physically remove gross contamination.</b> Use any stiff material (stick, cardboard,
plastic strip, metal banding strap) to physically remove gross contamination from the patient's MOPP
ensemble. Much of the CW agent contamination can be removed through physical means.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> <b>Step 2. Decontaminate the patient's mask and hood.</b> The patient has been triaged and
stabilized (if necessary) by the senior trauma specialist in the patient decontamination area. A two-man
decontamination team moves him to the litter stands at the clothing removal station.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Decontaminate the mask and hood.</b> Use the SDK, or use a 5 percent hypochlorite
solution or household bleach to sponge down the front, sides, and top of the mask hood. Decontaminate
spots with the SDK or the 5 percent hypochlorite solution.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Remove hood.</b> Remove the hood by cutting the hood. Before cutting the hood, dip the
cutting device in a 5 percent hypochlorite solution. For the M17-series mask, cut the neck cord and the
small string under the voicemitter. Release or cut the hood shoulder straps and unzip the hood zipper. Cut
the hood, close to the filter inlet cover and eye-lens outsert, upward to the top of the eye-lens outsert, and
across the forehead to the outer edge of the other eye-lens outsert. Proceed downward toward the patient's
shoulder, staying close to the eye-lens, then across the lower part of the voicemitter to the zipper. After
dipping the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution, cut the hood from the center of the
forehead over the top of the head (see <a href="#FIG_G-3">Figure G-3</a>). Fold the left and right sides of the hood to the side of
the patient's head, laying the sides of the hood on the litter. For the M40-series protective mask cut the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-8" id="Page_G-8">[G-8]</a></span>
hood shoulder straps, then cut the quick-doff hood from the front bottom center to the chin through the
elastic band under the chin. Fold the left and right sides of the hood over the shoulders away from the head.</p>

<p class="center"><i><a name="FIG_G-3" id="FIG_G-3"></a>Figure G-3. Cutting the M17 protective mask hood.</i></p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(3) <b>Decontaminate the protective mask and exposed skin.</b> Using the SDK, soap and
water, or a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution, wipe the external parts of the mask. Cover the mask air
inlet(s) with gauze or your hand to keep the mask filter dry. Continue by wiping the exposed areas of the
patient's face, including the neck and behind the ears.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) <b>Remove the Field Medical Card.</b> Cut the patient's FMC tie wire, allowing the FMC to
fall into a plastic bag. Seal the plastic bag and rinse the outside of the bag with a 5 percent hypochlorite
solution. Place the plastic bag with the FMC under the back of the protective mask head straps. The FMC
will remain with the patient.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> <b>Step 3. Remove gross contamination from the patient's overgarment.</b> Remove all visible
gross contamination by scraping with a stick or other device.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <b>Step 4. Remove the patient's personal effects and protective overgarment.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Remove patient's personal effects.</b> Remove the patient's personal effects from his
protective overgarment and BDU pockets. Place the articles in a plastic bag, label with the patient's
identification, and seal the bag. If the articles are not contaminated, return them to the patient. If the
articles are contaminated, place them in the contaminated holding area until they can be decontaminated,
and then return them to the patient.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Cut the patient's overgarment.</b> The overgarment jacket and trousers may be cut
simultaneously. Two persons may be cutting clothing at the same time. <b>Cut around bandages,
tourniquets, and splints, leaving them in place.</b></p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">A cut is a separation of material by use of a cutting device that cuts
material into two pieces. EXAMPLE: Cutting the sleeve from the
cuff to the jacket collar is one cut.</p>

<p class="noindent">Bandages may have been applied to control severe bleeding
and are treated like tourniquets. Only medical personnel remove
bandages, tourniquets, and splints.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(3) <b>Remove overgarment jacket.</b> Make two cuts, one up each sleeve from the wrist up to
the shoulder, and then through the collar (<a href="#FIG_G-4">Figure G-4</a>). Do not allow the gloves to touch the patient along
the cut line. Dip the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution before making each cut to prevent
contamination of the patient's uniform or underclothing. Keep the cuts close to the inside of the arms so
that most of the sleeve material can be folded outward. Unzip the jacket; roll the chest sections to the
respective sides, with the inner surface outward. Continue by tucking the clothing between the arm and
chest. Roll the cut sleeves away from the arms, exposing the black liner.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(4) <b>Remove overgarment trousers.</b> Cut both trouser legs starting at the ankle as shown in
<a href="#FIG_G-5">Figure G-5</a>. Keep the cuts near the inseams to the crotch. With the left leg, continue cutting to the waist,
avoiding the pockets. With the right leg, cut across at the crotch to the left leg cut. Place the cutting device
in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Fold the cut trouser halves away from the patient and allow the
halves to drop to the litter with contaminated (green) side down. Roll the inner leg portion under and
between the legs.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(5) <b>Remove outer gloves.</b> This procedure can be done with one person on each side of the
patient working simultaneously. The decontamination team will decontaminate their gloves in 5 percent
hypochlorite solution. Next, lift the patient's arms up and out of the cutaway sleeves unless detrimental to
the patient's condition. Grasp the fingers of the glove, roll the cuff over the fingers, turning the glove inside
out. Do not remove the inner cotton glove liners at this time. Carefully lower the arms across the chest
after the outer gloves have been removed (<a href="#FIG_G-6">Figure G-6</a>). Do not allow the patient's arms to come into
contact with the exterior of his overgarment. Drop his gloves into the contaminated waste bag. Dip your
gloves in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(6) <b>Remove overboots.</b> Cut the overboot laces and fold the lacing eyelets flat outwards. If
the green vinyl overboot (GVO) is worn, first try to remove the overboot without cutting; if necessary, cut
the boot along the front. While standing at the foot of the litter, hold the heel with one hand, pull overboot
downwards, and then pull towards you to remove the overboot over the combat boot heel. Remove the two
overboots simultaneously. This reduces the likelihood of contaminating one of the combat boots. While
holding the heels off the litter, have a decontamination team member wipe the end of the litter with the 5
percent hypochlorite solution to neutralize any liquid contamination that was transferred to the litter from
the overboots. Lower the patient's heels onto the decontaminated litter. Place the overboots in the
contaminated waste bag. Decontamination personnel dip their gloves in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <b>Step 5. Remove patient's battle dress uniform.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Remove battle dress uniform.</b> Cut the BDU jacket and trousers as described above for
the protective overgarment. Roll the jacket and trousers as described for the protective overgarment.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Remove combat boots.</b> Cut the bootlaces along the tongue. Remove the boots by
pulling them towards you. Place the boots in the contaminated waste bag. Do not touch the patient's skin
with contaminated gloves when removing his boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-11" id="Page_G-11">[G-11]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(3) <b>Remove undergarments.</b> Remove the patient's tee shirt. Dip the cutting device in the 5
percent hypochlorite solution between each cut. Cut both sleeves from the inside, starting at the elbow, up
to the armpit. Continue cutting across the shoulder to the collar. Cut around bandages or splints, leaving
them in place. Next, peel the tee shirt away from the body to avoid spreading contamination. If the patient
is wearing a brassiere, cut it between the cups. Cut both shoulder straps where they attach to the cups and
lay them back off of the shoulders. Remove the patient's under shorts/panties by cutting from the lower
side of the hip to the waist on both sides. Fold the front flap of the shorts/panties down between the
patient's legs onto the litter. Do not allow the outside of the garment to touch the patient's skin. Remove
the socks and cotton glove liners. Do not remove the patient's identification tags.</p>

<p class="para-a"><a name="XX-1" id="XX-1"></a><i>f.</i> <b>Step 6. Transfer the patient to a decontamination litter.</b> After the patient's clothing has
been cut away, he is transferred to a decontamination litter or a canvas litter with a plastic sheeting cover.
Three decontamination team members decontaminate their gloves and aprons with the 5 percent hypochlorite
solution. One member places his hands under the patient's legs at the thighs and Achilles tendons, a second
member places his arms under the patient's back and buttocks, and a third member places his arms under
the patient's shoulders and supports the head and neck. They carefully lift the patient using their knees (not
their backs) to minimize back strain. While the patient is elevated, another decontamination team member
removes the litter from the litter stands and replaces it with a decontaminated (clean) litter. The patient is
carefully lowered onto the clean litter. The contaminated clothing and overgarments are placed in bags and
moved to the contaminated waste dump. The dirty litter is rinsed with the 5 percent hypochlorite solution
and placed in the litter storage area.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> <b>Step 7. Decontaminate skin.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Spot decontamination.</b> With the patient in a supine position, spot decontaminate the
skin using the SDK or a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution. Decontaminate areas of potential contamination.
Include areas around the neck, wrists, and lower parts of the face. Decontaminate the patient's identification
tags and chain, if necessary.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">Complete body wash is not appropriate and may be injurious to the
patient. During complete body wash, the patient would have to be
rolled over to reach all areas of the skin. This is not necessary for
adequate decontamination.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Trauma specialist care.</b> During decontamination, the clothing around bandages,
tourniquets, and splints was cut and left in place.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>The trauma specialist replaces the old tourniquet by placing a new tourniquet ½ to
1 inch above the old one. He then removes the old tourniquet and decontaminates the patient's skin using
the M291 pads or a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-12" id="Page_G-12">[G-12]</a></span>
The trauma specialist gently cuts away bandages and decontaminates the area around
the wound; dusts the wound with the SDK, or irrigates soft tissue wounds with the 0.5 percent hypochlorite
solution. If bleeding begins, the trauma specialist replaces the bandage with a clean one. The trauma
specialist ensures splints are not removed, but are decontaminated in place by applying the 0.5 percent
hypochlorite solution to them, to include the padding and cravats. Splints will only be removed by a
physician or under the supervision of a physician.</li>

placing them in a contaminated waste bag. Seal the bag and place it in the contaminated waste dump.</p>


<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> <b>Step 8. Transfer the patient across the shuffle pit.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) The patient's clothing has been cut away; his skin, bandages, and splints have been
decontaminated. Now the litter is transferred to the shuffle pit and placed upon the litter stands. The shuffle pit is
wide enough to prevent the patient decontamination team members from straddling it while carrying the litter.
Four decontamination team members transfer the patient to a clean treatment litter in the shuffle pit. A member
of the patient decontamination team removes the bagged FMC and holds it so that a trauma specialist on the clean
side of the hot line can read it. A trauma specialist on the clean side of the hot line prepares a new FMC before
the patient is moved to the clean area. The old FMC is disposed of with other contaminated waste.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Decontamination team members rinse or wipe down their aprons and gloves with the 5
percent hypochlorite solution.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Three decontamination team members lift the patient off the decontamination litter (see
<a href="#XX-1">Step 6</a> for lifting procedures).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-13" id="Page_G-13">[G-13]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(4) While the patient is elevated, another decontamination team member removes the litter
from the stands and returns it to the decontamination area. A trauma specialist from the clean side of the
shuffle pit replaces the litter with a clean one. The patient is lowered onto the clean litter. Two trauma
specialists from the clean side of the shuffle pit move the patient to the clean treatment area. The patient is
treated in this area or waits for processing into the CPS. The litter removed by the decontamination team

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> <b>Step 2. Decontaminate the patient's mask and hood.</b> After the patient has been triaged and
treated (if necessary) by the senior trauma specialist in the PDS, the patient (assisted by another ambulatory
patient or a member of the patient decontamination team, if necessary) begins the clothing removal process.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Decontaminate and remove mask hood.</b> Sponge down the front, sides, and top of the
hood with a 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Remove the hood by cutting (<a href="#FIG_G-3">Figure G-3</a>) or, with the quick-doff
hood or other hoods, by loosening the hood from the mask attachment points. Before cutting the hood,
dip the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Begin by cutting the neck cord and the small
string under the voicemitter. Next, release or cut the hood shoulder straps and unzip the hood zipper.
Proceed by cutting the hood upward, close to the filter inlet cover and eye-lens outserts, to the top of the
eye-lens outsert, across the forehead to the outer edge of the other eye-lens outsert. Proceed downward
toward the patient's shoulder, staying close to the eye-lens and filter inlet. Cut across the lower part of the
voicemitter to the zipper. After dipping the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution again, cut
the hood from the center of the forehead over the top of the head and fold the right and left sides of the hood
away from the patient's head, removing the hood.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Decontaminate the mask and patient's face.</b> Decontaminate the mask and the patient's
face by using the SDK or a 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution. Wipe the external parts of the mask; cover
both mask air inlets with gauze or your hands to keep the mask filters dry. Continue by wiping the exposed
areas of the patient's face, to include the neck and behind the ears.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> <b>Step 3. Remove Field Medical Card.</b> Cut the FMC tie wire, allowing the card to fall into
a plastic bag. Seal the plastic bag and rinse it with the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Place the plastic bag
under the back of the protective mask head straps.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>g.</i> <b>Step 4. Remove all gross contamination from the patient's overgarment.</b> Remove all
visible contamination spots by using the SDK (preferred method) or a sponge dipped in a 5 percent
hypochlorite solution.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>h.</i> <b>Step 5. Remove overgarments.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Remove the patient's personal effects.</b> Place the patient's personal effects in a clean
bag and label with the patient's identification. If they are not contaminated, give them to him. If his
personal effects are contaminated, place the bagged items in the contaminated storage area until they can be
decontaminated, then return them to the patient.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Remove overgarment jacket.</b> Have the patient stand with his feet spread apart at
shoulder width. Unsnap the jacket front flap and unzip the jacket. If the patient can extend his arms, have
him clinch his fists and extend his arms backward at about a 30° angle. Move behind the patient, grasping
his jacket collar at the sides of the neck, peel the jacket off the shoulders at a 30° angle down and away from
the patient. Avoid any rapid or sharp jerks that can spread contamination. Gently pull the inside sleeves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-16" id="Page_G-16">[G-16]</a></span>
over the patient's wrists and hands. If the patient cannot extend his arms, you must cut the jacket to aid in
its removal. Dip the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution between each cut. As with the
litter patient, cut both sleeves from the inside, starting at the wrist, up to the armpit. Continue cutting
across the shoulder to the collar. Cut around bandages or splints, leaving them in place. Next, peel the
jacket back and downward to avoid spreading contamination. Ensure that the outside of the jacket does not
touch the patient or his inner clothing.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) <b>Remove overgarment trousers.</b> Unfasten or cut all ties, buttons, or zippers before
grasping the trousers at the waist and peeling them down over the patient's combat boots. Again, the
trousers are cut to aid in removal. If necessary, cut both trouser legs starting at the ankle, keeping the cuts
near the inside of the legs, along the inseam, to the crotch. Cut around all bandages, tourniquets, or splints.
Continue to cut up both sides of the zipper to the waist and allow the narrow strip with the zipper to drop
between the legs. Place the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Peel or allow the trouser
halves to drop to the ground. Have the patient step out of the trouser legs, one at a time. Place the trousers
in the contaminated disposal bag.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) <b>Remove overboots.</b> Remove the patient's overboots by cutting the laces with cutting
device dipped in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Fold the lacing eyelets flat on the ground. Step on the
toe and heel eyelets to hold the overboot on the ground and have the patient step out of it. Repeat this
procedure for the other overboot. If the GVO are worn, first try to remove the overboots without cutting; if
necessary, cut the overboots along the front. If the overboots are in good condition, they can be
decontaminated and reissued.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) <b>Remove the patient's outer gloves.</b> Grasp the heel of the glove, peel the glove off with
a smooth downward motion. Place the contaminated gloves in a plastic bag with the overgarment jacket.
Do not allow the patient to touch his clothing or other contaminated objects with his exposed hands.</p>

<p class="para-1">(6) <b>Remove the patient's cotton glove liners.</b> Have the patient remove his cotton glove
liners to reduce the possibility of spreading contamination. Have the patient grasp the heel of one glove liner
with the other gloved hand, peeling it off of his hand. Hold the removed glove by the inside and grasp the heel
of the other glove, peeling it off of his hand. Place both glove inserts in the contaminated waste bag.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>i.</i> <b>Step 6. Remove patients BDU.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Remove the patient's personal effects.</b> Place the patient's personal effects in a clean
bag and label with the patient's identification. If they are not contaminated, give them to him. If his
personal effects are contaminated, place the bagged items in the contaminated storage area until they can be
decontaminated, then return them to the patient.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Remove BDU jacket.</b> Have the patient stand with his feet spread apart at shoulder
width. Unbutton the front flap of the jacket. If the patient can extend his arms, have him clinch his fists and
extend his arms backward at about a 30° angle. Move behind the patient, grasping his jacket collar at the
sides of the neck, peel the jacket off the shoulders at a 30° angle down and away from the patient. Avoid
any rapid or sharp jerks that can spread contamination. Gently pull the inside sleeves over the patient's
wrists and hands. If the patient cannot extend his arms, you must cut the jacket to aid in its removal. Dip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_G-17" id="Page_G-17">[G-17]</a></span>
the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution between each cut. As with the litter patient, cut
both sleeves from the inside, starting at the wrist, up to the armpit. Continue cutting across the shoulder to
the collar. Cut around bandages or splints, leaving them in place. Next, peel the jacket back and
downward to avoid spreading contamination. Ensure that the outside of the jacket does not touch the patient
or his inner clothing.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) <b>Remove BDU trousers.</b> Unfasten or cut all ties, buttons, or zippers before grasping the
trousers at the waist and peeling them down over the patient's combat boots. Again, the trousers are cut to
aid in removal. If necessary, cut both trouser legs starting at the ankle, keeping the cuts near the inside of
the legs, along the inseam, to the crotch. Cut around all bandages, tourniquets, or splints. Continue to cut
up both sides of the zipper to the waist and allow the narrow strip with the zipper to drop between the legs.
Place the cutting device in the 5 percent hypochlorite solution. Peel or allow the trouser halves to drop to
the ground. Have the patient step out of the trouser legs, one at a time. Place the trousers in the
contaminated disposal bag.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) <b>Remove undergarments.</b> Remove the patient's tee shirt. Dip the cutting device in the 5
percent hypochlorite solution between each cut. Cut both sleeves from the inside, starting at the elbow, up
to the armpit. Continue cutting across the shoulder to the collar. Cut around bandages or splints, leaving
them in place. Next, peel the tee shirt away from the body to avoid spreading contamination. If the patient
is wearing a brassiere, cut it between the cups. Cut both shoulder straps where they attach to the cups and
lay them back off of the shoulders. Remove the patient's under shorts/panties by cutting from the lower
side of the hip to the waist on both sides. Allow the shorts/panties to fall to the ground. Do not remove the
patient's identification tags.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>j.</i> <b>Step 7. Check patient for contamination.</b> After the patient's BDU and underwear has
been removed check the skin for contamination by using M8 detector paper or the CAM. Carefully survey
all areas of the patient's skin, paying particular attention to areas around the neck, wrist, ears, and
dressings, splints, or tourniquets.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>k.</i> <b>Step 8. Decontaminate skin.</b></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <b>Spot decontamination.</b> Use the SDK or the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution to spot
decontaminate exposed neck and wrist areas, splints, other areas where the protective overgarment was
damaged, and where dressings or bandages were removed. Decontaminate the patient's identification tags,
if necessary. Have the patient hold his breath and close his eyes. Have him, or assist him, lift his mask at
the chin. Wipe his face with the M291 pad or the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution. Wipe quickly from
below the top of one ear, being careful to wipe all folds of the skin, top of the upper lip, chin, dimples,
earlobes, and nose. Continue up the other side of the face to the top of the other ear. Wipe the inside of the
mask where it touches the face. Have the patient reseal and check his mask.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(2) <b>Trauma specialist care.</b> During clothing removal, the clothing around bandages,
tourniquets, and splints was cut and left in place.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>The trauma specialist replaces the old tourniquet by placing a new one ½ to 1 inch
above the old tourniquet. When the old tourniquet is removed, the skin is decontaminated with the SDK or
the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution.</li>

<li><i>Do not remove splints.</i> Decontaminate them by thoroughly rinsing the splint,
padding, and cravats with the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution.</li>

<li>Usually, the trauma specialist will gently cut away bandages. The area around the
wound is dusted with the M291 pad or rinsed with the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution, and the trauma
specialist applies the M291 pad or irrigates the soft tissue wound with the 0.5 percent hypochlorite solution.
If bleeding begins, the trauma specialist replaces the bandage with a clean one.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>l.</i> <b>Step 9. Dispose of contaminated waste.</b> Dispose of contaminated bandages and coverings
by placing them in a plastic bag and sealing the bag with tape. Place the plastic bags in the contaminated
waste dump.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>m.</i> <b>Step 10. Proceed through the shuffle pit to the clean treatment area.</b> Have the
decontaminated patient proceed through the shuffle pit to the clean treatment area. Make sure that the
patient's boots are thoroughly decontaminated by stirring the contents of the shuffle pit with his boots as he
crosses it. The patient will remove his combat boots and socks at the entrance of the clean treatment area or
CPS; remove the protective mask at the entrance to the clean treatment area or inside the ambulatory air
lock of the CPS.</p>

FIELD EXPEDIENT PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS AGAINST
NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL ATTACK</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_H-1" id="Para_H-1"></a>H-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">Medical units must have protection from NBC attack and contamination to survive and function effectively.
The extent of protection provided is only limited by the resources available and efforts of unit personnel.
Protection as simple as an individually dug foxhole or as elaborate as the subbasement of a concrete building
may be used. Expedient protection from the effects of biological and chemical agents are usually much less
labor intensive.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_H-2" id="Para_H-2"></a>H-2. Protection Against Radiation</h4>

<p class="noindent">The level of protection from radiation is expressed in terms of shielding. Material is available on the battlefield
to construct/prepare expedient fallout shelters that offer substantial shielding against gamma radiation (see
<a href="#TAB_H-1">Table H-1</a>). Generally, the denser or heavier the material, the better shielding it offers. The degree of
protection afforded by a fallout shelter is expressed as a "protection factor," or a "transmission factor." The
protection factor is simply the fraction of the available radiation dose that penetrates the shelter and reaches
those inside compared to the radiation received by an unprotected person. Thus, a protection factor of 2
indicates that an individual in the shelter receives one-half of the radiation dose he would receive if unprotected.
A protection factor of 100 (associated with about six half-value thicknesses) indicates that only 1/100 or 1
percent of the radiation dose reaches the inside. Transmission factors are expressed in percentages, or in
decimals. Either refers to that fraction of the ambient unshielded dose that is received by personnel within the
shelter. Fallout gamma transmission factors for some common shelters are shown in <a href="#TAB_H-2">Table H-2</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_H-3" id="Para_H-3"></a>H-3. Expedient Shelters for Protection Against Radiation</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> In many cases it will be unnecessary to construct field expedient or other types of fallout
shelters. There are many structures and terrain features available that afford a degree of fallout protection.
Existing fallout shelters are tunnels, caves, culverts, overpasses, ditches, ravines, and man-made structures.
The best existing shelters are basements. <a href="#FIG_H-1">Figure H-1</a> shows typical protection provided in buildings.
Windows can be sandbagged or covered with dirt from the outside to provide additional protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_H-3" id="Page_H-3">[H-3]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Planners should attempt to locate HSS units near existing shelters, whenever possible. However,
if an HSS unit is already established, or must be established where fallout shelters are not available, then a
shelter must be constructed. Elaborate shelters are not required, since they usually only need to be occupied
for a few days. There are a number of field expedients that will serve to save personnel and patients even
though they may not be comfortable for those few days.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> When engineer support is available, a bulldozer trench about 2.7 meters (9 feet) wide and 1.2
meters (4 feet) deep can be dug (<a href="#FIG_H-2">Figure H-2</a>). The length of the trench will be determined by the number of
patients/personnel to be sheltered. About 0.6 meter (2 feet) length of trench is required for each person to be
sheltered. These trenches reduce exposure of personnel lying on the floor to about 20 to 30 percent of the
radiation that they would receive in the open. Protection and comfort can be improved, as time permits, by
digging the trenches deeper; undercutting the walls (care must be taken in this option; the earth may cave in);
erecting tents over the trenches; and providing improved flooring. When used with other individual and
collective protection measures, bulldozer trenches provide adequate fallout shelters for most situations; they
can be provided in a minimum of time and effort. Trenches should not be dug in areas subject to flooding
during rainstorms; a berm should be formed on the uphill side of the trench to direct water around the trench
in the event rainfall occurs in the area. Undercutting will not be possible in sandy soil; also some form of
support to keep the walls from caving in is required.</p>

<p class="center"><i><a name="FIG_H-2" id="FIG_H-2"></a>Figure H-2. Dozer trench.</i></p>


<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> Dug-in tents (<a href="#FIG_H-3">Figure H-3</a>) for hospitals provide more comfort and require less movement than
the bulldozer trench; however, they have two drawbacks. First, they offer far less radiation protection than
the bulldozer trench, and second, they require considerably more engineer effort. This option should work
well with GP tents, but will probably be hard to accomplish with the TEMPER.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> Sandbagged walls around the hospital tents, as shown in <a href="#FIG_H-4">Figure H-4</a>, or lightly constructed
buildings provide protection from fallout. Sandbagged walls 1.2 meters high give significant protection (20
to 40 percent transmission factor); however, the effort required to achieve the protection is such that it is
marginally feasible. Sandbagging is an effective means for supplementing other shelters by&mdash;</p>

patients and unit personnel. As time permits, improve these shelters by deepening, covering, undercutting,
and sandbagging.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> When CPS systems are not available, well-sealed shelters (TEMPER, ISO, and GP) can
significantly minimize or prevent the entry of CB agents. The ventilation system must be turned off, and
kept off, before, during, and after the attack. The shelter must be totally sealed during this time to maximize
protection. <a href="#TAB_H-3">Table H-3</a> provides examples of protection values for well-sealed shelters. For example, a well-sealed
TEMPER will only permit 1/60 of the CB agent outside to enter the shelter. If a persistent agent is
used, be aware of agent off-gassing hazards. Persistent agents can penetrate TEMPER fabric and create a
vapor hazard inside. In a CB agent attack, ensure that all staff and patients are protected by wearing their
MOPP or are in PPWs.</p>

DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL,
AND CHEMICAL CONTAMINATION IN WATER</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_I-1" id="Para_I-1"></a>I-1. General</h4>

<p class="noindent">Water supplies in areas with NBC contamination and in surface water supplied by runoff from such areas
will most likely be contaminated. The contamination of water, whether intentional or inadvertent, may
reach concentrations that will produce casualties. By special methods of analysis, the presence of
contamination can be determined. Treatment of contaminated water requires chemicals and equipment that
are only available to quartermaster water purification units; individuals or units should not attempt to treat
their water. Decontamination of water is only undertaken when uncontaminated sources are not available;
then ONLY with the approval of the medical authority (PVNTMED or surgeon).</p>


<h4><a name="Para_I-2" id="Para_I-2"></a>I-2. Detection of Contamination in Water</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Detection of nuclear contamination in water is accomplished by using the AN/PDR77, AN
PDR/27 or AN VDR/2 radiac meters.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="bbox2 wd75 font-sans small">
<p class="center bold">CAUTION</p>

<p class="noindent">DO NOT allow the probe to come into contact with the water
source; allow at least one inch of air space between the probe
and water surface. </p>
</div>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Detection of BW agents in water is accomplished by the use of field biological water test kits and
specially designed collection and detection kits. The specialty kits will be provided as needed, and will be
available to PVNTMED and supporting medical laboratory personnel. When required for the President and
Secretary of Defense purpose, samples must be collected and prepared for shipment to the supporting medical
laboratory. A chain of custody document must be prepared by the collector and maintained as the sample(s) is
being transported to the supporting medical laboratory and throughout its transit to the CONUS laboratory.
See <a href="#APP_F">Appendix F</a> for details on suspect BW sample collection, packaging, chain of custody, and handling.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> The Chemical Agent Water Testing Kit, M272, provides a rapid field test to detect chemical
agent contamination in water. The test must be conducted before the water is treated with chlorine; the
chlorine will affect the accuracy of the test for chemical agents.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_I-3" id="Para_I-3"></a>I-3. Procedures on Discovery of Contamination in Water</h4>

<p class="noindent">When contamination is discovered the following actions are taken:</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a.</i> Mark the water source, using the standard NBC contamination markers, and ensure that
personnel do not consume the water until approved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_I-2" id="Page_I-2">[I-2]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b.</i> Notify the commander that the water source is contaminated and unfit for drinking, food
preparation, and personal hygiene.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c.</i> Notify the supporting water production unit, such as the quartermaster water production and
distribution unit of the contaminated water source.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> The commander establishes safeguards to prevent personnel from using the contaminated
water supply.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>e.</i> An alternative source of uncontaminated water is sought and used. The primary source for
obtaining water is from quartermaster-operated water production and distribution points. Other sources are
considered only when quartermaster-operated faculties are not available. Alternative sources that may be
considered include&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Ground water sources that are least likely to be contaminated.</li>

<li>Local fixed facility water supplies. However, these supplies must be tested before use.
If NBC contamination is found do not use.</li>

<li>Using another location to obtain an uncontaminated water source, when the tactical
situation permits.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-a"><i>f.</i> Contaminated water must not be used until it has been treated by quartermaster water
production and distribution units or other equally capable water purification units and approved for use by
the medical authority.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_I-4" id="Para_I-4"></a>I-4. Treatment of Contaminated Water</h4>

<p class="noindent">Contaminated water requires additional equipment and supplies to remove the contamination. Quartermaster
water purification and distribution units are equipped to perform these duties. See FM 10-52 for details.</p>

FOOD CONTAMINATION AND DECONTAMINATION</h2>


<h4><a name="Para_J-1" id="Para_J-1"></a>J-1. General</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a. Food Susceptibility.</i> Stored, transported, and prepared food is susceptible to NBC
contamination throughout the TO. Planning for any battle or operation must include food protection from
contamination; food contamination detection; and contaminated food disposition (decontaminate or destroy).</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b. Countermeasures.</i> There are three primary countermeasures to overcome or reduce the NBC
hazard to food:</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Contamination avoidance.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Nuclear, biological, and chemical agent detection.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Nuclear, biological, and chemical agent decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c. Priorities.</i> The priorities for conducting NBC countermeasures are&mdash;</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) <i>Contamination avoidance.</i> Contamination avoidance includes using natural and fabricated
barriers to prevent, or significantly reduce the spread of contamination. Also, using specific procedures for
entry and exit between contaminated and uncontaminated areas reduce the potential for spreading
contamination. Use of these barriers and procedures may reduce the subsequent need for detection and
decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) <i>Detection, measurement, and identification.</i> These activities are essential for determining
the presence, extent, and nature of NBC contamination. This information is essential in identifying the
existence of uncontaminated supplies, or decontamination requirements.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) <i>Decontamination.</i> Decontamination removes the contaminant and provides food that is
safe for consumption.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d. Decontamination.</i> Decontamination efforts require an extensive amount of labor, time, and
supplies. The use of hasty decontamination is emphasized. That is, decontaminate just enough to sustain
operations and keep fighting, rather than to make a contamination-free environment. Normally,
decontamination efforts will be limited to the packaging and packing materials. Food decontamination will
only occur in critical situations where other food supplies are not available. Most decontamination is
performed in or very near the AO. Before beginning decontamination procedures, divide exposed food
items into groups based on protection of item at time of exposure. These groups establish priorities based
on ease of decontamination and the ability to monitor the food.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Group I&mdash;Canned or packaged items exposed only to a chemical agent vapor.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Group II&mdash;Canned or packaged items that are contaminated on the outside with a liquid
chemical agent, a biological agent, or radioactive fallout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-2" id="Page_J-2">[J-2]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Group III&mdash;Unpacked or poorly packaged items that have been exposed to any NBC agent.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Group IV&mdash;Food contaminated through the food chain.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_J-2" id="Para_J-2"></a>J-2. Protection of Food from Contamination</h4>

<p class="noindent">An adequate defensive posture for a chemical attack will also protect food against biological contamination
and radiation fallout.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>a. Operational Rations.</i> Operational rations include, but are not limited to, MREs; unit group
ration (UGR), A; unit group ration, heat and serve; and medical diet supplement.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Packaging materials and storage methods normally protect these rations. The packaging
and packing of operational rations protect the contents from deterioration. As a result, the contents are
protected from moisture, to include chemical liquids, chemical vapors, and biological agents. Operational
rations delivered to an AO will usually have increased levels of packaging and/or packing protection.
Operational rations are substantially protected while contained in the shipping cases, especially if protected
with an overlay of fiberboard, shrink wrap, or film wrap.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Enclosed storage is used whenever possible. Refrigerated warehouses, cold storage
rooms, and even prefabricated refrigerators and trailers provide excellent protection. Underground shelters,
caves, and tunnels that can be made airtight provide maximum NBC protection. Buildings provide protection
depending on how well they can be closed and sealed. The basement of a building is a good storage place.
However, keep in mind that chemical vapors tend to seek out low-lying areas. Storing rations indoors will
protect them from liquid droplet and fallout contamination unless the building is damaged by an attack.
Complete protection against chemical vapors is only offered by airtight closed spaces like cold storage
facilities.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Chemical protective measures are to be integrated into daily logistical operation to avoid
the contamination of operational rations. Maximum use is made of alarm and detection equipment,
overhead shelter, shielding materials, and protective covers. Back up stocks of operational rations should
be dispersed to minimize the risk of destruction or contamination.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) An NBC Protective Cover or similar equipment will help greatly. The NBC Protective
Cover is discarded and replaced upon becoming contaminated; it reduces overall decontamination
requirements; and it improves the survivability of supplies and equipment. The NBC Protective Cover
provides 24-hour protection against liquid chemical contamination. Detection paper used on the NBC
Protective Cover will rapidly identify a contaminated cover.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b. Bulk and Fresh Foods.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Field expedient or improvised storage may be the only choice available under high-risk
conditions. Expedient storage for food supplies may be a natural or man-made depression lined to protect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-3" id="Page_J-3">[J-3]</a></span>
contents against moisture, and then covered with earth and sod. The earth gives good protection against all
forms of chemical or biological contamination and nuclear fallout.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Foods are only stored outdoors or in partially protected areas when absolutely necessary.
Only cases of foods packed in cans, bottles, or airtight foil or film wraps, and foods packed in sealed boxes
or multilayered wrappings can be subjected to exposed storage. Partial protection is provided by open
sheds, temporary roofing, or tents. When subsistence must be stored in the open, give as much protection
as possible. Protection material may include NBC Protective Covers, tarpaulins, tarpaulin sheds, or any
other available covering such as plastic sheeting. Tarpaulins and other treated or waterproof coverings do
not prevent contamination by chemical vapors, but they do reduce contamination from liquid agents.
Canvas will keep out more than 95 percent of liquid contamination for a short period of time after the
attack. The canvas must be removed soon after the attack to prevent the agent from seeping through onto
the subsistence; placement of spacers between the covering and the food will greatly reduce this problem.
Even the thinnest material will offer some protection and is better than nothing at all. Therefore, food
supplies must be covered by whatever material is available.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_J-3" id="Para_J-3"></a>J-3. Nuclear</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a. Contamination.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Following a nuclear detonation, food can become contaminated in three ways:</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li><i>Direct contamination.</i> Direct contamination results by fallout collecting on plants,
animals, and stored food (surface contamination). Fallout has two effects. First, it produces a gamma
radiation field over the fallout area. Second, it contaminates the surface of anything on which it is
deposited. The whole-body gamma irradiation hazard to an individual far outweighs any potential hazard
from food contamination. The basic rule is: If you can safely be in the area to salvage the food, then the
food salvaged is safe to use (although slightly contaminated).</li>

<li><i>Indirect contamination.</i> This form of contamination can be spread throughout the
food chain. Humans can ingest contamination by eating plants that have absorbed radioactive isotopes;
products (milk or meat) from animals allowed to graze on contaminated pastures; or fish from
contaminated water.</li>

<li><i>Induced radiation.</i> It is possible that food will be exposed to sufficient neutron flux
(an increase in the number of free neutrons) as the result of a nuclear explosion to produce considerable
induced radioactivity in food without it being destroyed by blast and heat. This is possible with enhanced
radiation weapons in the energy range of 1 KT where the radiation kill radius exceeds the blast destruction
zone. The elements that are most prominently involved are sodium, potassium, sulfur, copper, bromine,
zinc, and especially phosphorous. Thus, in an area of induced radiation, foods requiring the most caution
are dairy products, high salt content foods, dry beans, raisins, and ready-mixed cake and biscuit flours.
The radioactivity has a short half-life; therefore, the radiation will decay very rapidly. It should be possible
to consume foods containing induced radiation within a week or two. Cans, particularly those with "C"
enamel, may incur a high level of induced radiation (from zinc in the enamel, not from iron in the can).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-4" id="Page_J-4">[J-4]</a></span>
Glass, because of its high salt content, will show very high levels of activity; clear glass will turn brown.
Container radioactivity has no bearing on the food, it is safe to use. The radioactivity is not transferred to
the contents. No significant toxic by-products are formed in the exposed canned food.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(2) Consumption of food contaminated with radioactive fallout may cause a risk of radiation
injuries from internal radiation; that is, radiation from radioactive sources within the body. Most isotopes
will pass through the digestive tract or be excreted very quickly. However, the intestinal tract may receive
a considerable dose. Some isotopes are more hazardous because they are absorbed from the digestive tract
and enter the metabolism of man and animals.</p>

<ul class="pad4">
<li>Strontium-89 (Sr-89) and Strontium-90 (Sr-90) are beta emitters and have half-lives
of 51 days and 28 years, respectively. Therefore, Sr-90 is the greatest radiation hazard in the long term.
These two isotopes are absorbed in the body and used in the same way as calcium. They accumulate in
bone, where bone marrow with its blood forming cells is vulnerable. Milk and other dairy products are the
primary sources of Sr-89 and Sr-90 in the human diet.</li>

<li>Iodine-131 (I-131) is a beta and gamma emitter and has a short physical half-life of
approximately 8 days. It is efficiently absorbed and used by the body. Iodine-131 will contaminate plants
that will be eaten by grazing animals. Smaller amounts can also be absorbed by breathing contaminated air.
Cattle will excrete a large amount of I-131 in milk. Milk and other dairy products are the primary sources
of I-131 intake. One can also get smaller amounts by eating contaminated fruits and vegetables. Iodine-131
will be concentrated in the thyroid gland. The intake of I-131 will have its greatest impact the first few days
to weeks following a nuclear explosion.</li>

<li>Cesium-137 (Cs-137) is a beta emitter and has a half-live of 30 years, but is
eliminated relatively quickly from the body. The biological half-live is 70 to 140 days. Cesium-137 is
found in most tissues of the body, but it will concentrate in muscle tissue. Cesium-137 is absorbed and used
the same way as potassium. Meat and milk are the primary sources of Cs-137. Much precipitation, lack of
minerals in the soil, and extensive cultivation increase the plants' absorption of Cs-137; thus, the
contamination of plant products.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(3) Operational rations are safe when surface decontamination is performed before breaking
the package. Operational rations stored close to ground zero may become radioactive from induced
radiation. It is more likely, however, that the food will be damaged or destroyed by the blast and thermal
effects of the nuclear explosion.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Bulk and fresh food stored in the open without protection will be contaminated.
Decontamination is very difficult and time-consuming. Efforts should be made to ensure proper packing to
prevent food contamination from radioactive fallout. Packing made from hard and nonporous materials,
such as plastic or multilayer cardboard with a smooth surface, should be used. In addition, storage facilities
should be enclosed to avoid the entry of fallout. Any material used as a protective cover will give some
protection against nuclear fallout. Protection against induced radiation, blast, and thermal effects requires a
hardened shelter or underground storage.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Food supplies require protection throughout the chain of production or procurement.
Protection of the civilian-based food supply includes countermeasures along the production chain. Meats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-5" id="Page_J-5">[J-5]</a></span>
and milk are the most vulnerable products because of the possibility for concentration of radioactive
isotopes (Strontium, Cesium, and Iodine). The primary, and possibly the only, protection of animal
products is to keep the animals indoors and to avoid contaminated fodder. Immediate slaughter of food
animals is recommended if there is a shortage of uncontaminated fodder. Also, food animals exposed to
fallout should be considered fit for consumption and slaughtered using routine procedures. Unharvested
crops cannot be protected.</p>


<p class="para-a"><i>b. Inspection and Monitoring.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Fallout close to ground zero, especially after a surface burst, may be visible as dust. The
presence of dust is an immediate indicator of contamination. Fallout on unprotected food produces a
grittiness that is unpleasant and warns against eating the food. The degree and means of food protection
(packaging and storage faculties) must be considered. Food in a building that remains intact should not
receive enough contamination to be dangerous when eaten.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Veterinary units have the AN/VDR2 Radiac Set and UDR13 dosimeter to conduct
ground or aerial surveys for gamma radioactive contamination levels in an area. The measurement of the
external gamma radiation in the fallout area is an indication, but not a quantitative measure, for the degree
of hazard from food contamination. These units also use the AN/VDR2 Radiac Set for point detection of
gamma and beta radiation sources. Food monitoring is conducted in an area with low background radiation.
If the storage area is contaminated, the food must be moved to a cleaner area for monitoring. With the AN/VDR2,
the initial food monitoring is performed with the probe cover in place and the probe passed
approximately 6 inches from the surface. If the reading is twice the background dose rate, the food is
considered contaminated. If the reading is not above the background level but contamination is still
suspected, place the probe closer to the food with the beta probe cover off. Monitor meat and fish with the
probe cover off; pass the probe approximately one-half inch from the surface of the food.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Monitoring food contaminated through the food chain is more complicated; depending
on the detection instrument used, special procedures must be followed. Gamma and beta emitting
radionuclides in small volumes may be detected using radiac sets such as the AN/VDR2; however, alpha
emitting ones cannot. They are rough instruments and may be used only for screening surface contaminated
food. To evaluate the hazards; the isotopes contributing to the radioactivity must be identified. Surface
contaminated food will contain a mixture of isotopes with some more hazardous than others, depending
upon whether they are used by the body. Milk will contain mostly I-131, Cs-137, Sr-89, and Sr-90. Meat
and fish will contain mostly Cs-137. To verify I-131, Cs-137, Sr-89, and Sr-90 contamination, samples
must be sent to laboratories equipped to analyze the samples.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) All newly selected food supplies must be surveyed. Begin continuous monitoring
immediately following receipt of a fallout warning, or when increased levels of radiation are detected by
periodic monitoring.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Periodic monitoring is needed to establish baseline levels of background radiation in the
environment and various food products. This monitoring is performed during peacetime, when possible,
and throughout the time US forces are deployed in a TO.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>c. Decontamination.</i> There are two methods for nuclear decontamination: aging and removing.
Aging is the process of allowing natural radiation decay to occur. The time necessary for this decay to take
place depends upon the isotopes present; each has a different decay rate (half-life). Aging may not be
possible when there is a short food supply. In some instances, such as with induced radioactivity, it may be
the only way to decontaminate. Removing nuclear contamination from areas, personnel, food, or moving
equipment to another location eliminates the immediate hazard. To determine which decontamination
method is required, food supplies are divided into groups. See <a href="#TAB_J-1">Table J-1</a> for additional information on food
items and decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Group II&mdash;Food in sealed and dust-proof packing such as cans, jars, fiberboard, and
cellophane. These products are easily decontaminated by removing the radioactive dust covering the
packing; brush, wash with soap and water, or remove the packing (depending on the type of packing
material). If radiation is still detected after removing the dust, repeat the brush/wash procedure and
remonitor. If radiation is still present, the food itself is then considered radioactive (induced radiation) and
is unfit for consumption. Decontamination of induced radiation is possible only through aging. After aging
one to two weeks, the food should be safe for consumption. After surface decontamination, the contents are
safe to eat unless the food has induced radiation.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Group III&mdash;Unprotected food. The method chosen to decontaminate unprotected food
items will depend upon whether or not the food supply is critical. If the food supply is not critical, the
contaminated items are isolated and allowed to decontaminate by aging. If the food supply is critical, food
with surface contamination can, in principle, be decontaminated by removing the contaminated surface, or
by washing.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Some products can be decontaminated by washing, peeling, or trimming the outer skin or
leaves. Decontaminate potatoes and hard-skinned fruits and vegetables by washing or scrubbing under
running water, followed by peeling or scraping, then washing again. Potatoes, carrots, beets, and turnips
can be washed at the supply depot. However, do not wash beans, rice, and onions until they are delivered
to the field kitchen; washing reduces their storage quality and shelf life. Citrus fruits, pineapples, corn,
peas, beans, melons, pumpkins, cabbage, and nuts can be peeled. Decontaminate cucumbers, tomatoes,
cherries, cranberries, grapes, pears, plums, and thin-skinned squash by soaking in a water or detergent
solution and rinsing with vigorous agitation or brushing. Apricots, peaches, most berries, asparagus,
broccoli, and leafy vegetables cannot be satisfactorily decontaminated because of fuzzy surfaces, irregular
shapes, or small size, which makes washing difficult.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fresh carcass meat, sausages, and fish can be decontaminated by several washings
with cold water. The exterior layer of the food item is removed if radioactivity is still present. There is,
however, a risk of contaminating the inner parts of the foodstuff in the process. Cooking with several
changes of water is the last step in decontamination.</li>

<ul>
<li>Decontaminate hard cheeses, margarine, and butter by cutting off the outer layer to
a depth of 2.5 to 3 cm.</li>

<li>Let cooking oils stand for 3 to 5 days, then pour off the contaminated layer; use a
funnel to control spillage.</li>

<li>Nonperishable items that are hard to decontaminate, such as flour, sugar, and salt,
can be set aside allowing natural radioactive decay. When supplies are short, dilute the contamination by
mixing with uncontaminated food. This will reduce the total amount of radioactive exposure in foods
prepared using these contaminated items.</li>

<li>Decontaminate air permeable, double-sacked goods by removing the outer sack. If
the inner sack is free of radiation, double sack the food again to restore protection. However, when
contamination is present on the inside bag, the food in contact with the bag is likely to be contaminated.
Three methods can be used to handle this type of contaminated product. The easiest method involves
spraying the bag of dry goods (except sugar or salt) with water. This will wet a layer of the food inside the
bag. The wet layer can be removed when the bag contents are emptied. The uncontaminated contents are
scooped back into clean packaging. Another method involves using melted paraffin to uniformly coat the
outside of the bag. The paraffin solidifies after 30 to 40 minutes, and then the bag with the radioactive
contamination can be removed from the contents. Although this method will seal the radioactive substance
in the wax, it probably will not remove the layer of contaminated food product inside the bag. For the third
method, form a piece of sheet metal into a cylinder the same height as the bag and 4 to 6 cm smaller in
diameter. Insert the cylinder into the bag, then remove the top 3 to 4 cm of the contaminated product.
Carefully scoop the remaining product out into a clean sack. With the cylinder still in place, fold the bag
down catching the contaminated product on plastic sheeting, or a tarpaulin. When using this method,
mixing the contaminated portion with the uncontaminated portion is a problem. Check for contamination
remaining in the product.</li>

<li>Boiling or cooking has no effect on radioactive contamination.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para-1">(4) Group IV&mdash;Food contaminated through the food chain. It is not practical to
decontaminate this food. Meat and milk are the two most common foodstuffs contaminated in this way.</p>

<ul>
<li>Milk may be decontaminated to a safe level by a complicated ion exchange process.
The I-131 activity will decline rapidly during storage of milk and milk-products, although the Cesium and
Strontium activity will remain almost constant for years. In an area with high-level fallout, milk is
withdrawn from human consumption. The duration of withdrawal will be dependent upon the type of
fallout and levels.</li>

<li>Meat may be decontaminated to a safe level by soaking in water or brine. Cesium
is loosely bound in the meat. By repeated soaking of meat cut in small pieces, most of the Cesium activity
will be removed. Traditional meat preserving, such as salting with brine, will remove up to 60 to 70
percent of the Cesium activity. See <a href="#TAB_J-2">Table J-2.</a></li>

<li>Fruits, vegetables, root crops, and grain products may also contain hazardous
amounts of radioactivity if ingested.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-9" id="Page_J-9">[J-9]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Food animals. Food animals that have been exposed to fallout should be considered fit
for consumption and slaughtered using routine inspection and slaughter procedures. In those cases where
the animal has been exposed to fallout, but is not scheduled for immediate slaughter, the radiation burden
can be reduced by moving the animal to an uncontaminated area (barn if available) and washing it with soap
and water. Mild radiation sickness does not necessarily mean that the animals cannot be used for food. If
the animals have been exposed to an internal radiation hazard, the meat can be eaten if the internal organs
are discarded. Chickens that have eaten radioactive material may lay contaminated eggs, but most of the
radioactivity will be concentrated in the shells. The white and yolk will be free of harmful amounts of
radiation and can be eaten. Chickens will not lay eggs if the radioactive body burden is large enough that
their eggs are unfit to eat.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>d.</i> <i>Considerations When Decontamination is Not Possible.</i> When food cannot be decontaminated,
sealing the product in a wrapping material or container may be needed. Sealing the product can reduce or
shield the emanation of the contamination and/or fix the contamination in place. The hazard from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-10" id="Page_J-10">[J-10]</a></span>
contaminated food is small compared with that from external gamma radiation. Hungry people or animals
should not be denied food because of possible fallout contamination. It is not practicable or desirable to preset
maximum permissible limits of gross fallout radioactivity as a basis for judging whether or not food
should be used. Common sense must be applied in establishing priorities for distribution of available food.
For example, use the least contaminated and the most protected food first; hold milk products for 1 to 2
weeks before use.</p>


<h4><a name="Para_J-4" id="Para_J-4"></a>J-4. Biological</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a. Contamination.</i> Biological warfare agents exist in the form of toxins and microorganisms.
The normal packaging and packing of food (to protect against moisture, dust, and bacterial or other
contamination) provides protection against most biological agents. The exception may be toxins and
biologically derived substances. However, the protective methods used for chemical agents will also
protect against toxins and derived substances. Food in freezers, refrigerators, and in refrigerated trucks or
rail cars will be safe if these containers remain sealed until the outer surfaces are decontaminated.</p>

<p class="para-1">(1) It is unlikely that a biological agent will affect the appearance, taste, or smell of the food
enough for the change to be apparent.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Packaging and packing materials are not life supportive to pathogenic agents and are,
therefore, self-decontaminating with the exception of spore-forming organisms.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Most operational rations are packaged in metal containers, or encased in heavy aluminum
laminated plastics that can withstand boiling water; also, they are impervious to arthropod penetration. This
food is highly resistant to biological agents.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) The use of unpackaged items (unwrapped meats, fresh fruits, and vegetables) should be
restricted; use only operational rations. Unprotected fresh food stored in the open and close to the source of
dissemination will become contaminated.</p>

<p class="para-a"><i>b. Detection.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Rapid identification of agents used is absolutely essential to implement effective
countermeasures. Agent identification must be achieved quickly; it is the first step in answering critical
management questions. What adjustments must be made in food preparation and distribution? What are the
essential countermeasures? What is the expected outcome of the incident?</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Samples of food that are suspected of being contaminated are transported to the designated
supporting laboratory. Samples must be accompanied by a description of the samples, the sample collection
procedures, and the circumstances, which prompted the collection. The designated medical laboratory in
the TO will provide a field confirmation identification of the agent(s). Designated CONUS laboratories
accomplish definitive identification. See <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a> for sampling procedures.</p>

<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTE</p>

<p class="noindent">New biological detection equipment is under development that will
enable units to conduct presumptive identification of biological warfare
agents. However, samples must also be collected and processed as
described in <a href="#APP_B">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-a"><i>c. Decontamination.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Food contaminated with toxins is handled in the same manner as food contaminated with
chemical agents. Food contaminated with microorganisms is handled in the same manner as when
contaminated with the more common foodborne disease-producing microorganisms.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Several methods are available to decontaminate food items contaminated with biological
agents. The following decontamination methods are considered to be the minimum. See <a href="#TAB_J-1">Table J-1.</a></p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Group II food that is sealed in containers that are resistant to the passage of biological
agents requires only that the exterior of the container be decontaminated. Decontamination of these items is
as follows:</p>


<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) For containers made of metal, glass, plastic, or porcelain:</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>1.</i> Thoroughly wash the container in potable water and soap, or in a disinfectant
solution. If the water used for washing is contaminated, the soap and water wash may increase, not reduce,
the contamination hazard. After which, the food containers are immersed in a disinfectant solution for 30
minutes (see <a href="#TAB_J-3">Table J-3</a>); then rinsed with potable water, if available and time permits. Chlorine solutions
are not as reactive or corrosive as DS2.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>2.</i> Place the containers in boiling soapy water for 15 minutes; then rinse with
potable water.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<div class="center wd70">
<p class="center bold">NOTES</p>

<p class="noindent">1. The chemical field decontamination kits do not meet the
requirements to decontaminate food supplies exposed to biological
agents.</p>

<p class="noindent">2. The same procedures should be followed even if there is only
suspicion of a biological warfare attack.</p>
<br />
</div>


<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Thoroughly wipe containers that will not withstand soaking with a cloth soaked in a
chlorine detergent solution. Remove the food from the container and place it in Group III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-12" id="Page_J-12">[J-12]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Metal or glass containers determined to have trichothecenes (Yellow Rain) present
can be decontaminated using DS2. Allow a contact time of 5 to 30 minutes for the DS2 to neutralize the
toxin. Then rinse the container with potable water.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Group III food items that are not protected by the packaging material are decontaminated
or disposed of as follows:</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Decontaminate foods that can be peeled or pared by immersing them in a disinfectant
solution for 30 minutes, and then rinsing them with potable water (see <a href="#TAB_J-3">Table J-3</a>). Peel or pare the items
after decontamination, then wash and, if appropriate, cook before eating.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) With the exception of certain heat-stable toxins, heat is the most practical means of
decontaminating food. Several heating methods may be used, but the method chosen depends upon the type
of food to be decontaminated. The key is to apply as much heat as possible without rendering the food unfit.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>1.</i> Cook in a pressure-type cooker with 15 pounds of pressure at 250°F (121°C)
for 15 minutes.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>2.</i> Cook in a low-pressure cooker at 228°F (109°C) for 1 hour.</p>

<h4><a name="Para_J-5" id="Para_J-5"></a>J-5. Chemical</h4>

<p class="para-a"><i>a. Contamination.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Contamination of foodstuffs by a chemical agent may occur at any point on the battlefield.
This contact may render the food unpalatable also. In many cases, decontamination is difficult, thus,
emphasis must be placed on protection. Keep food supplies covered at all times. Take special precautions
to protect food that is not packed in protective packages. Unprotected food, forage, and grain supplies may
be so contaminated that their consumption will produce gastrointestinal irritation, or systemic poisoning.
Nerve agents, vesicants, and arsenicals are the most dangerous. Field concentrations of phosgene,
hydrocyanic acid, irritants, and smokes will seldom be high enough to cause serious food contamination.
The effect of CK on food is not known. As a precaution, foods exposed to CK should be considered toxic.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) The effects of chemical agents on food depend on the nature of the agent and the type of
the food. The extent to which chemical agents penetrate food also depends on the amount, form of dispersal
(liquid [droplet size], or vapor) and duration of exposure. Nerve agents and mustard will penetrate deeply
into unprotected fatty foods and will readily penetrate granular products such as grain and sugar. Liquid
food products can be completely contaminated. Arsenicals readily hydrolyze to poisonous arsenical oxides
in some foods. Foods can be divided into three categories based on their water content, fat content, and
crystalline structure:</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Foods having a high water content, a low fat content, and/or a crystalline structure
(fresh vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, and eggs) will absorb mustard and nerve agents, either as a liquid or as
a vapor. Nerve agents will be hydrolyzed slowly.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Foods having a low fat content and an irregular (amorphous) structure (flour,
bread, grain, rice, cereals, dried fruits, dried vegetables, tea, coffee, peas, and beans) readily absorb
mustard and nerve agents in liquid form. As a vapor, these agents are absorbed to some extent, but are
easily removed by airing.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Foods having a low water content and a high fat content, such as butter, fat, fatty
oils, ham, cheese, milk, bacon, fatty meat, and fish, absorb mustard and nerve agents such that removal of
the agents is virtually impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-14" id="Page_J-14">[J-14]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Chemical agents can be physically and chemically absorbed into food. In addition to the
toxic effect, they often adversely affect taste, smell, and the appearance of the food. However, chemical
agents can cause the food to become very toxic without causing any other changes in the food. <a href="#TAB_J-4">Table J-4</a>
shows the effects of a number of chemical agents on food. Since food can be contaminated without any
outward change in appearance, the possibility of contamination must be assumed in a chemical agent
environment. Treat the food with the same precautions as established for known contaminated items.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) The protective properties of packaging materials are dependent upon a number of factors.
The factors include the form of the agent (liquid versus vapor); concentration and exposure time; weather
(temperature, wind speed, and humidity); and packaging material (the type of material, thickness, and the
presence of folds, tears, and small holes). Even the thinnest material will offer some protection and is better
than nothing at all. Therefore, always cover food supplies with whatever material is available. <a href="#TAB_J-5">Table J-5</a>
summarizes the protection values of various packaging materials against vapors and liquids.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Operational rations are substantially protected while contained in the shipping cases
and especially if stored in the original palletized unit load with an overlay of fiberboard, shrink wrap, or
film wrap. The worst case is pallets of subsistence contaminated by liquid droplets during an attack. After
the attack, high vapor concentrations will exist in the vicinity of the palletized loads. If the outer barrier is
permeable such as fiberboard, it is possible that a liquid agent can seep through the overlay fiberboard and
contact the shipping containers in liquid form. Normally, with seepage resistant materials, such as shrink
wrap as the outer barriers, only the vapors of the agent are found within the pallet.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) While MREs are stored, the food is protected by up to six layers of material.
Multilayer barriers result in a complex diffusion process of the agent from the outside towards the interior.
Vapor penetration into nonhermetically sealed spaces is a simple gaseous diffusion process. Permeation
through packaging is a much more complex process regardless of whether the challenge is a liquid or a vapor.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>1.</i> Liquid is adsorbed into permeable materials such as fiberboard or chipboard.
With permeation-resistant materials (such as shrink wrap), the agent dissolves into, seeps through, and then
desorbs from the barrier material. Shrink wrap provides adequate protection. Fiberboard sheathing
provides adequate protection against mustard agents, but not against nerve agents.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>2.</i> The low-density polyethylene used to construct the menu bag can absorb
chemical agents and possibly toxins. If the menu bag is removed from the shipping container and is exposed
to liquid contamination, enough agent may pass through the bag to create a health hazard. Keep MREs in
the shipping container until issued to the soldier. The menu bags should then be kept under the same degree
of protection as the soldier.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>3.</i> The aluminum-laminated materials used to construct the MRE (retort and
nonretort) pouches protect food from chemical contamination if hermetically sealed. The only item in the
MRE meal bag that is not adequately protected is the spoon.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Mylar and cellophane are resistant to chemical agents.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-a"><i>b. Detection.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Currently, a field method for detecting chemical agent contamination in food does not
exist. Contamination is not always spread evenly throughout food; this makes it impossible to take a single
sample and determine the presence or absence of chemical agents in the entire lot. Additionally, standardized
laboratory tests have not been developed for determining levels of chemical agents in food. Until a specific
method to detect chemical agents in food is available, reliance will have to be made upon determination of
contamination, or lack thereof, on the packaging material; the integrity of the packaging material; the protective
qualities of the packaging material; and the penetration characteristics of the suspected chemical agents.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) Food may become toxic without any change in outward appearance. Never taste or
smell food to determine if contamination is present in food.</p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Veterinary and subsistence units have the following equipment available to detect
chemical agents in the field:</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) The M8 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm System consists of the M43 detector
unit and the M42 alarm unit. The detector unit is a portable, automatic, point-monitoring device that is
designed to be hand carried from point to point. The M8 is used to provide early warning of a toxic agent
position and detects the presence of chemical vapors and aerosols. The M43 detects all nerve, blood, and
choking agents, and some blister agents. The M43A1 (the replacement for the M43) only detects nerve
agents.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) The M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit detects and identifies nerve, blood, and
blister agents. The M256 is the most sensitive of the chemical agent vapor detectors available. However, it
is not a continuous, real-time monitoring system. It requires 15 to 20 minutes for sampling and analysis.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) The ABC-M8 VGH Chemical Agent Detector Paper can detect and differentiate
between nerve and blister agents by color change. It is intended to be used by blotting and wiping surfaces
suspected of contamination. The M8 paper will respond with a visual color change in 10 seconds or less.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>d</i>) The M9 Chemical Agent Detector Paper will detect liquid nerve (G &amp; V) and
blister agents (H &amp; L), but will not identify the specific agent or differentiate between nerve and blister
agents. The M9 tape is sensitive to droplets as small as 100 μ, and will respond with a visual color change
in 10 seconds or less.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) All subsistence in a chemical attack area are considered contaminated until a survey can
be conducted, preferably by veterinary and chemical personnel. Personnel must be at MOPP Level 4 while
conducting the survey. Concentrate the initial portion of the survey on the adequacy of the storage facility
and other protective measures in preventing chemical agent contact with subsistence items. The area
surrounding the storage facility is examined for the presence of animals, rodents, birds, and arthropods
acting unusual, or dead in unusual numbers. If animals are present and assistance is required in identifying
the NBC agent, specimens can be collected and submitted to the area medical laboratory. Damage such as
broken windows, holes, or loss of structural integrity of the storage facility is noted. This information
combined with knowledge of the agent form (liquid or vapor), type of agent (which will indicate the degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-17" id="Page_J-17">[J-17]</a></span>
of persistency), and approximate time of attack will provide a risk assessment. Liquid agents should not
significantly penetrate an intact facility, but may produce vapor contamination by off-gassing.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Upon entering the storage facility, the M8 can be used to determine the presence of
chemical vapors. However, precautions must be taken. The M42 alarm is not to be used inside shelters,
vehicles, vans, or other interior modes. Therefore, when checking food storage facilities, the alarm unit
must be left outside, turned off, or disconnected. Do not tilt the M43 detector more than 45 degrees
(because of the liquids it contains). This is not a problem with the improved M43A1, but the M43A1
requires attachment of an exit port filter when used indoors. The M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit can
be used to sample the air.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Pre-position M9 chemical agent detector paper in food storage areas; especially on
the least protected pallets and in areas where droplets may enter, such as near doors or windows. Examine
the M9 paper for indications of liquid chemical agents. If the M9 paper is positive, or if the packaging
materials show the presence of liquids or stains, use the M8 detector paper to determine the type of the
agent. If an agent is not indicated by the detector paper, then the amount of agent present will be
insufficient to cause secondary contamination when the outer package is removed.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Detection procedures become more complicated if a chemical agent has penetrated or
permeated through the packaging and packing materials. Unless liquid has seeped through the cardboard,
any agent in the interior of the shipping case will be in a vapor form. Liquid seeping should be obvious.
The sampler-detectors in the M256 Chemical Agent Detector Kit do not have an aspirator for sampling the
interior of the case. However, there are several procedures that can be used. One is to open the case, place
the activated sampler-detectors inside the case, and then reclose the case. Another is to punch holes in the
case, place the activated sampler-detector over the holes, and cover the sampler-detector with an empty box
or can (open end down) to concentrate the vapors escaping from the case. Alternatively, remove the food
from the case and place it in a plastic bag with the sampler-detectors to concentrate the vapors. These
procedures require two sampler-detectors; one for blood agents and one for nerve and blister agents.
Neither method is very sensitive in low concentrations of vapor as is expected to be present inside shipping
containers. A better method is to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'modify to M43'">modify the M43</ins> detector with a field expedient probe of Teflon tubing
attached to the detector's air inlet. Insert the open end of the tubing into a hole in the case or package to
sample the interior air. When available, the improved chemical agent monitor (ICAM) can be used; its
design will allow aspiration of air from inside shipping cases. The ICAM can also be used to detect and
identify liquid agents on a surface provided the agent is vaporizing in sufficient quantity. The ICAM gives
a visual representation of a hazard evaluation.</p>


<p class="para-a"><i>c. Decontamination.</i></p>

<p class="para-1">(1) Decontamination is only required for contamination remaining 10 minutes or longer.
Decontamination efforts on subsistence items will normally be limited to removal of the containers and
carton overwrap material.</p>

<p class="para-1">(2) The need for decontamination is primarily dictated by the type of chemical agent used.
The method of decontamination selected will depend upon the type of packaging material used and the
urgency with which the food is required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-18" id="Page_J-18">[J-18]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1">(3) Food supplies in storage are not likely to be seriously contaminated if reasonable
protection precautions are taken. For this reason, large supplies of food are not to be condemned as a whole
simply because they have been exposed to possible chemical contamination. A prompt and careful survey
of the supplies may reveal that only a few items have been contaminated to a level that decontamination is
required. Prompt segregation of the heavily contaminated portions will prevent, or minimize, contamination
of the remainder. Foods without protective packages constitute the major difficulty.</p>

<p class="para-1">(4) Individual decontamination is performed by each soldier on those subsistence items in his
possession at the time of the attack. Individual decontamination is limited to operational rations that are in
original, intact containers. Unit-level decontamination is performed by unit personnel under the supervision
of unit NBC personnel. Support decontamination is attempted at major subsistence storage facilities.
Again, decontamination is limited to packing material. Decontamination of food itself is only attempted in
emergency situations when alternative supplies are not available.</p>

<p class="para-1">(5) Start decontamination operations with the easiest method and proceed to the most difficult.
This allows for the removal of a relatively large portion of the contamination in a minimum of time. The
simplest procedure is to allow the materials to age and air ("weather"). Substantial self-decontamination
will occur with most agents. Exceptions are thickened mustard, thickened GD, and VX. <a href="#TAB_J-6">Table J-6</a> provides
the length of time for which contaminated subsistence supplies may present a contact hazard. Weather
elements that affect decontamination are&mdash;</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Warm temperatures speed liquid agent off-gassing and hasten the dispersion of
chemical agents into the air.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) High winds rapidly disperse chemical agent vapors and speed off-gassing from
surfaces.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Moisture causes chemical agents to react with water to form nontoxic or less toxic
chemicals. Heavy rain or rain of long duration can aid decontamination by mechanically removing
chemical agents.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>d</i>) Even in cold weather, direct sunrays warm surfaces above the air temperature and
hasten the off-gassing and decomposition of chemical agents.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-1">(6) Active decontamination is attempted only when weathering will not decontaminate the
packaging material in sufficient time. Decontamination procedures can be enhanced by using heat to
vaporize the chemical agent; by reaction with decontaminants; or by removing with hot soapy water.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) The simplest (standard) decontamination materials are water and detergents. An
effective decontaminant is hot water used with the addition of soap or detergent and scrubbing. Commercial
abrasive powdered cleansers are effective decontaminants for many surfaces (metal, glass, Formica), but
not wood or soft plastics.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Water can be used to flush chemical agents from surfaces. High-pressure application
produces a better cleansing action than low pressure. If the surface has absorbed the agent, flushing will
remove the surface contamination, but will not affect the agent that is absorbed.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Soaking contaminated items in boiling water is an excellent decontamination method
for some agents. Water alone will not be sufficient to decontaminate all chemical agents. Soaking in warm
or cold water may reduce the contamination slightly; however, the hazard may not be reduced sufficiently
even after prolonged soaking. If hot water is not available, or if it might cause damage to the item, other
methods of decontamination should be considered, such as decontaminating solutions or a caustic solution
followed by thorough rinsing.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>d</i>) Fibrous materials such as cloth and canvas are best decontaminated by washing and
scrubbing.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>e</i>) Glass, metal, porcelain, and plastic surfaces are best decontaminated by using hot
water or hot soapy water. Some toxic materials are readily removed with no more than slight abrasion or
brushing.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>f</i>) Painted, varnished, and waxed surfaces are generally smooth and nonporous. Dust
and liquids are readily removed by wiping, brushing, or vacuuming. Absorbed materials are removed by
hot water, detergent, or complexing agents. None of these surfaces stand up well to heavy abrasive
techniques. Agents can be attacked and removed by caustics, acids, and organic chemicals. Some of these
surfaces readily absorb agents, so weathering following decontamination is advisable.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>g</i>) Rubber is a porous material that can absorb agents. It is not easily decontaminated
by abrasive techniques. Warm, soapy water used with brushing is effective since it removes some absorbed
contamination. Strong acids, alkalies, and organic solvents may deteriorate and decompose rubber articles.</p>

<p class="para-1">(7) Operational rations are the primary rations issued; always issue uncontaminated stocks
first. This allows for decontamination of contaminated stocks without interrupting supply support.
Normally, contaminated stocks are not issued. The decision to issue contaminated items is based on the
tactical situation, criticality of the items, type and extent of contamination, and the time and resources
available for decontamination. Decontamination efforts on subsistence items are limited to the containers
and carton overwrap material.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) The MRE retort and nonretort food pouch may be decontaminated with soap and
water wash. The chemical agents will be removed by the solutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-20" id="Page_J-20">[J-20]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Semipermeable materials (polyethylene menu bag, shrink wrap, and film wrap)
may have chemicals deposited not only on the surface, but also dissolved into the matrix of the material.
The chemicals can be removed from the surface by washing with hot soapy water, but contaminant
dissolved in the material is not removed. The remaining agent can only be removed by weathering which
can be accelerated through the use of heat and sweeping the surface with air.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Fiberboard is both sorbent and permeable and acts like a blotter. Liquid
decontaminants can force the contaminant further into the fiberboard. Any attempt to decontaminate
fiberboard would be futile. The only alternatives are to remove the fiberboard, or to allow it to weather.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>d</i>) Palletized unit loads of MRE and UGR outerwraps can be decontaminated through
the aid of a forced clean air sweep in 4 to 5 days, compared to 3 weeks or more under natural conditions
without a forced air sweep.</p>

<p class="para-1">(8) Contaminated food supplies are only handled by personnel trained in decontamination
methods and in MOPP Level 4. Contaminated food items are divided into three groups as described below
(see <a href="#TAB_J-1">Table J-1</a> for additional information).</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>a</i>) Group 1 consists of canned and unopened packaged items which have been exposed
only to agent vapors. Most items in this group will be safe to issue after a brief period of outdoor airing to
remove clinging vapors. Table J-7 lists the decontamination procedures for packaging materials
contaminated with nerve agents, mustards, and arsenicals.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="para-aa">(<i>b</i>) Group II consists of canned and unopened packaged items which have been
contaminated with a liquid chemical agent.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>1.</i> Attempts to decontaminate porous packaging materials, such as cardboard or
wood, are likely to be unsuccessful and may result in spreading the contamination. The best procedure in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-21" id="Page_J-21">[J-21]</a></span>
handling such items is to strip off the outer contaminated coverings and examine the inner layer to see if
penetration of the agent has occurred. If it has, continue stripping off layers until an uncontaminated layer
is reached and place it in Group I. If the agent has penetrated to the food, place it in Group III.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>2.</i> Food in cans or in other sealed, impermeable containers is not in danger of
chemical contamination. Because contamination is confined to the outer surface of the sealed container,
decontamination is accomplished by: immersion in boiling, soapy water for 30 minutes and rinse; immersion
in boiling water for 30 minutes; spray with DS2; or to wash in hot soapy water, rinse, and aerate. Under no
conditions should contaminated containers be opened before they have been decontaminated and monitored.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>3.</i> Supertropical bleach and DS2 can be used on the polyethylene menu bag for
up to 24 hours without a significant change in appearance, tensile properties, and size of the plastic. The
use of DS2 will cause significant degradative changes to most other plastics, while STB will cause little or
no change. Also, DS2 may cause false positive readings when using M8 or M9 paper, or the M256
Detector Kit to check completeness of decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-aa">(<i>c</i>) Group III will consist of unpackaged or poorly packaged items which have been
exposed to an agent in either vapor or liquid form. Foodstuffs in this group should be decontaminated only
when absolutely necessary. <b>The decision to use foods that have been contaminated is to be made by the
commander.</b> Decontamination procedure to be followed, in order, is: trim surface fat and grossly
contaminated areas; wash with water or 2-percent sodium bicarbonate solution; then boil in water.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>1.</i> Boiling in water may be eliminated when the contamination has been only
with the vapors of irritant agents. When such an exposure has been light, aeration for a short time may be
used for decontamination.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>2.</i> Frying, roasting, or broiling will not remove traces of blister agents from
meats. In general, salvage of foods heavily contaminated with droplets of the blister agents, especially the
arsenical blister agents, is not practical. Foods of high water or fat content are unfit for consumption and
reclamation is not practical when contaminated with liquid mustard or a liquid nitrogen mustard.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>3.</i> When foods have been exposed to blister agent vapor, they can be reclaimed
by washing with sodium bicarbonate solutions and rinsing with clear water, by intensive cooking, or in the
case of dry provisions, by 24 to 48 hours of aeration. Lean meat contaminated with mustard vapor can be
reclaimed by boiling in water for 30 minutes or more. With nitrogen mustard vapor contamination, the
meat should be boiled in a 2-percent sodium bicarbonate solution. Discard the water used to boil the meat.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>4.</i> Nerve agent contamination is treated the same as blister agent contamination.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>5.</i> Foods, such as potatoes and hard-skinned fruits and vegetables, can be
decontaminated by washing or scrubbing, followed by peeling or scraping, then washing again.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>6.</i> Prepared food in open containers will be contaminated; it must be temporarily
isolated, or disposed of (bury or as directed by commander).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_J-22" id="Page_J-22">[J-22]</a></span></p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>7.</i> A food Item that is contaminated with irritants can be decontaminated by
airing. Consumability is determined by taste rather than toxicity.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>8.</i> Phosgene is rapidly hydrolyzed, therefore, washing the food with water or
airing it will usually suffice.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>9.</i> Food contaminated with white phosphorous should be destroyed.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>10.</i> Normally, hydrocyanic acid will have little effect on food supplies. The
exposures will most likely be as a vapor. However, foods with a high water content may become unfit for
consumption after exposure to high concentrations.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>11.</i> The effect of CK on foods is not known. Foods exposed to CK vapors are
considered toxic.</p>

<p class="para-1x"><i>12.</i> <a href="#TAB_J-8">Table J-8</a> lists the decontamination procedures for unpackaged food
contaminated with a chemical agent.</p>

<p class="para-1">(9) Decontaminating cattle, poultry, and other livestock is only attempted when other sources
of food are not available. Heavily contaminated animals should be destroyed. Livestock contaminated
lightly by phosgene, nerve agents, mustards, and arsenicals (such as vapor or liquid) may be slaughtered in
the early stages of poisoning before the full effects of exposure are shown. If these animals are slaughtered
in the preliminary stages of poisoning and all tissues exposed to the agent (the head, blood, lungs, organs,
and local areas) are discarded, there is no danger in consumption of the meat, provided the animal passes a
pre-slaughter and slaughter inspection. This is true even of animals poisoned by arsenical agents since the
edible tissue will contain amounts of arsenic too small to be toxic. Organs (liver, brain, heart, kidney, and
lungs) will contain more arsenic than the musculature and are discarded. The meat must be well cooked.
Personnel involved in slaughtering procedures must be careful to prevent spreading contamination to the
meat and to themselves.</p>

<p class="para-1">(10) Decontaminating forage and grain exposed to only chemical agent vapors is by aeration.
Aerated supplies, especially if mixed with larger amounts of uncontaminated supplies, produces no ill
effects when fed to animals. Forage or grain heavily contaminated by liquid vesicants, especially arsenicals,
should not be used.</p>

<b>Biological Warfare Agent Field Confirmation Identification &nbsp;</b> Identification of a suspect biological
warfare agent by means of devices/materials/technologies that are based on detecting biological
markers using two or more independent biomarker results. Examples might include the findings of
the presumptive biomarker identification with the addition of a positive PCR, ELISA, or
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) results, using specific target nucleic acid sequences for the
organism and antibody recognition of agent-specific antigen sites, respectively. (Field sample/specimen
identification by forward deployed or forward positioned laboratories [such as the US Air
Force Biological Augmentation Team (BAT), theater army medical laboratory, or forward deployed
preventive medicine unit (US Navy) and homeland security Laboratory Response Network (LRN)
Level B or C, US Army Community Hospitals or Medical Centers].)<br />
<br />
<b>Biological Warfare Agent Definitive Identification And Confirmation &nbsp;</b> The specific identification of a
suspect biological agent as to genus and species, serological type, or toxin. This level of
identification is by means of devices/materials/technologies that are based on two or more
independent biomarker results and using different methodologies. This level of identification is
performed in a reference laboratory with a broader variety of methodologies available and highly
skilled testing personnel, thus providing the highest levels of accuracy. (Sample/specimen
identification is accomplished by homeland security LRN Level C and D and nationally recognized
laboratory such as the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease or Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.)<br />
<br />
<b>Biological Marker &nbsp;</b> Characteristics of a biological agent (organism, virus, toxin, or product) that are
specific to the agent. This includes (1) recognition of specific nucleic add sequences (DNA or
ribonucleic acid [RNA]) unique to the bacteria or virus by a technique such as PCR; (2)
identification of specific ECL assay; (3) specific growth properties as seen on selective media such
as characteristic colony morphology on culture along with phage inhibition; (4) Identification using
specific microscopic characteristics such as Gram stain, fluorescent antibody stain,
immunohistochemical stain, or cytopathic effects.<br />
<br />
<b>Biological Warfare Agent Presumptive Identification &nbsp;</b> Identification of a suspect biological warfare
agent by means of devices/materials/technologies that are based detecting biological markers
(biomarkers) using a single methodology. The biomarkers and/or methodologies used at this level
of testing have significant limits to their accuracy. Agent identification to species level, or
differentiation among a family of similar agents, may not be possible. This is equivalent to the LRN
Level A and the US Army BIDS. (EXAMPLES: Identification by sensor triggering, hand-held
devices [hand-held assays] or initial systems, or laboratory analysis employing one screening
methodology [such as microscopic morphology, antibody/protein, or nucleic acid-based test].)<br />
